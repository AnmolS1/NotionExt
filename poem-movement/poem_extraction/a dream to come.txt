a dream to come

a simple scene
i sit on a wicker chair
staring out the large windows
of my pet caf”
where pets come to rest and play
while She feeds our Þrst cat
i write my next novel
as i throw my hands up
in pure desperation for words
a small orange kitten
comes along
not much bigger
than my own hand
he puts his tiny paw
on the space bar
of my computer
and i know exactly
what this cute bean wants
so i pick him up
and put him on my shoulder
i walk around the caf”
showing him all the birds
colorful and chirpy as can be
and he simply stares at them
with curiosity in his eyes
and a hopefulness in his paws
he yawns
so i put him down
on his favorite pillow
and i pull his favorite blanket
over his tiny body
and i take a look around
at all the smiling faces
the happy children
the ecstatic animals
the sun slowly sinking outside
and Herand i know
that somewhere, somehow
i made a good choice
