yestermorrow

somehow he'd had it wrong
how he could've missed it
he had no clue
there they were
the screen flickered on
and so began a new story
perhaps a comedy
maybe a romance
who knew?
but there it was
when he thought she couldn't see
he looked over at her
she seemed like a dream
she was glowing in the low light
skin soft as silk
her hair auburn, flowing like the nile
curled up
he only wished she was closer
but there he was wrong
her eyes
for they were not simply
sea green
as he had thought before
but some mixture
of an emerald, filled with millennia
of knowledge
and an orange, gentle sunset
greys fortified like the pantheon
he saw in her some gentle force
unknown, waiting to be explored
and he was ready
