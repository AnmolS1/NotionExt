in her heart

once upon a time there was a girl
who moved ever so fast, like a whirl
with her joy she swept others off their feet
her heart was so big, clouds knelt in defeat
but nobody knew just how she was
how she truly felt, clenching her jaws
indeed she was quite upset, quite very sad
and there were very few days which weren't so bad
she felt sad and mad and a tad had too
in fact, she almost forgot how it felt
to not feel so blue
then one day she happened to meet
this boy who seemed, ever so sweet
and the rest of this story?
well, it's not quite so bleak
