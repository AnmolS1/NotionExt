sea green eyes

as she untied her shoelaces
he wondered what must have
been going through her mind
if any of it was about him
or if his suspicions
were correct
and she had simply
forgotten how she had felt
all that time ago
but then she finished
looked up at him and smiled
with those red lips
she knew exactly
what she was doing to him
and she knew what
he was thinking too
she was thinking the same
she wanted him
as much as he wanted her
perhaps even more
but time was not
of the essence
she could wait
he saw it
that knowing smile
her dimples pulled him
deeper and deeper
she was playing again
after all
she knew his favorite
crimson red
