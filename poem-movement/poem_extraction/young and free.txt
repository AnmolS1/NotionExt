young and free

mere months left
how could he possibly say them?
those words of young disposition
so revealing, intimate in their use
it was more than he could bear
as his condition worsened
his inability to think around her
his flustered attempts
to make conversation
but he was ok with not talking
because he could simply listen
to her go on for hours
and never get bored
watching as her eyes
lit up with passion
hearing her ideas
she was brimming with talent
beauty
confidence
and the only jokes
that could make him
truly smile
