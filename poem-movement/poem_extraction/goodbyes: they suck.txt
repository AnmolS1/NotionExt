goodbyes: they suck

our ßights were at the same time
so we went to the airport together
knowing we would be leaving
alonethrough security we reminisced
laughing the whole wayup until the endreaching her gate i knew
this was really it
i was off to my college
and she was off to hers
there was some Þnality
in that moment
we both knew it was
entirely unlikely
we would ever
cross paths again
and so i had to say it
those 3 stupid words
they had always seemed
quite pointless to me
but then i knew
i love you
