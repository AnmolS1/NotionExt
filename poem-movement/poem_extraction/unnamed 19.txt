im just not there anymore.
im not at that point where
one can simply be happy.
i dont know how to just
be happy, and forget
about all the other crap.
i cannot stop thinking
about all that crap.
i cannot stop thinking
and yet
it hurts so much when i do.
it hurts so fucking much
that i need to do a lot more
than pinch myself
to make sure its real.
