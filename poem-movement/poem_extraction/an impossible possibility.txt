an impossible possibility

there is no end in sight for me
this will carry onwards
for a lifetime and beyond
because your beauty
while outwardly undeniable
truly lies in your existence
and your existence
is everything to me
from your tired laughs at 1am
to your stressed forehead
before AP exams
from your thick glasses
still somehow leaving you blind
to your desire for productivity
always pushing your limits
i truly can't imagine life sans you
without your cute smiles
in the morning
without your warm hugs
before leaving for the day
without your stuffed llama
the ßufÞest thing on earth
i think this is what they call love
what i feel now for you
and this is our day
so let's love each other boo
