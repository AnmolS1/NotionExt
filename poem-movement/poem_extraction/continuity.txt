continuity

invisibility
unknown
where did the time go?
he sees her smile everywhere
still knowing it's never her
but he's still here
breathing
deep breaths
the room seems so much smaller
and everyone else
so much farther away
breaths become quicker
eyes dart faster around the room
hands shake, too weak to dial
911anxious
scared
dark
but still here
deep breaths
keep breathing
he knows what he needs
and that getting it
will be the hardest thing
he's ever
had to do
but goodbyes
were never easy anyways
