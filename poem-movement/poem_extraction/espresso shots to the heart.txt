espresso shots to the heart

somehow she made him smile
no matter what kind of day he'd had
no matter how heavy his heart felt
all she had to do was say a simple
"hi"
show off her incomparable smile
she was his morning coffee
his afternoon pick-me-up
and the perfect end to his every night
and of course he could never resist
a smile of his own
