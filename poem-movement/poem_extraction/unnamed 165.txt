unnamed 165

you are a perfectly balanced masterpiece
based on thousands of years of evolution,
on a microscopic rock,
ßying around a massive fucking burning
ball of plasma,
which is fucking ßying around a rip
in the space-time continuum,
which in and of itself is a small dot
in the grand scheme of the universe.
and you're worried about the smallest of things.
