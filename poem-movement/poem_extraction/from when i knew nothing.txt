from when i knew nothing

they are abound
hopping without care
multiplying the same way
i search for one
just one
i only need one
please let me understand one
i cannot go without one
quite simply one
i must know at least one
and so i caught one
but now
the window has cracked
the dam has burst
the bomb has gone off
the tear has dropped
one settles in under
and another comes from above
another on my arm
yet another on my leg
they cover me
all i can do
is stay awake
and pray they only prey
in my sleep
