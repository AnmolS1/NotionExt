brisk

another late night
the wind is audibly hard
and plastic wickets barely hold on
we all know the slightest hit
will send them flying
our bowler winds up
ready for a fast one
and suddenly
lets his arms fall
he shakes his head and walks back
as far back as he can
in this parking lot
we see his eyes dart up
with a smirk on his face
he sprints towards the line
and lets loose
