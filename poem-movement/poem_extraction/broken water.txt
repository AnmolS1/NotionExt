broken water

i always knew you'd be my end
only after you had become
all of my beginnings
and somehow
i was okay with it
378 days
the length of time for which
i've known to be prepared
for this particular night
i know i've become your burden
perhaps your greatest one
so as i end the river we created
together
i'll jump the waterfall you built
alone
