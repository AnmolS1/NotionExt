death of a human

now i am old
the fur around my muzzle turns grey
my joints now ache
as we walk down the road together
but she still remains unchanged
her hair glossy
her skin fresh
her step sprightly
time cannot touch her
and yet
i love her still
for generations
she has watched over us
from my great-great-great-great-great-grandfather
she has kept us safe
warm
and fedbut now i see differently
as my hair turns to grey
and my joints become stiff
so too do hers
my only hope now
is that i may last
until her Ãžnal moments
for the death
of one of her kind
is so rare
the ending of a lifesuch a tragedy
yet i know
she takes comfort in my presence
and so i wish
to provide my last comfort
at her end
