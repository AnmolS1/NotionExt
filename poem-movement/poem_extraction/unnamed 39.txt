unnamed 39

i believe that
all one needsin this life
is one moment
one simple moment
of pure ecstasy
where nothing matters
everyone is happy
everything is okay
nothing else exists
except this moment
i have never
not even once
heard of it
nor seen it
but this moment
it must exist
i need itif it doesi will Ãžnally
have one reason
to keep going
