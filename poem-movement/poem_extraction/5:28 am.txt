5:28 am

there are only dark roads here
solely lit by the overhead
lusterless lamps
early 2000s pop plays
we hum along
and the car continues forward
this truly is the end of it all
Ãžres rage miles behind us
the screams have long since
been drowned out
no longer do we see the
bloody parts of bodies
on the sides of the road
exploded apart and rotten
a tiny giggle pops its head up
in a baby blue carseat
10 months old
i turn around and smile
but then i hear a scream
my wife is beside me
looking at the sky
and as i look up
i notice a large object falling
while realizing what it is
i also realize that it's too late
before a burst of white
and a fade to black
