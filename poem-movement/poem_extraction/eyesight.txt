eyesight

it happenspeople leave
ice cream melts
milk spills
promises break
words lie
and hopes die
your heart contorts and cracks
as your mind slows
remembering every
single
detail
the memories replay
it's ok to let the rivers flow
let them roll down your cheeks
let yourself be heard
if only by yourself
but in the end
you must always remember this
sometimes
what breaks your heart
ends up
fixing your vision
