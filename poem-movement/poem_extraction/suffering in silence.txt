suffering in silence

he walks the halls laughing
every day
and nobody knows his secret
he sits at the same lunch table
every day
and nobody knows his secret
he sits through each class
every day
and nobody knows his secret
he screams into the same pillow
every day
and nobody knows his secret
he wakes up without sleeping
every single day
and still, nobody knows his secret
