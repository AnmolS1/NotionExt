depression is back
i guess it never left
hiding in the corners of my mind
laughing as it watched me
pick up the pieces of my life
loneliness is back
maybe it never left
hiding in the tips of my Ãžngers
giggling as it watched me
holding on to people who leftthe lies are back
i thought they left
hiding behind my eyes
smirking as it watched me
disappoint the ones i love
the voices are back
i knew they hadn't left
hiding in the silence i made
watching as i drove myself insane
the cuts are back
i'd hoped they left
hiding under my perfect skin
waiting on me
to commit the painful sin
suicide is back
i wish it never left
hiding within my empty heart
smiling as it followed me
back to the train tracks
depression is back
i wonder if it ever left
