an image's prescription

i saw you today
it was early in the morning
before the coffee had kicked in
while the dew was still fresh
you were just sitting there
reading quietly
and i wanted to say something
anything
but i couldn't
because where the butter√üies
used to be
exists a pit now
a deep hole of memories
that we once shared
memories that i wish we could
laugh about togetherbut we can't
because i screwed up
again
