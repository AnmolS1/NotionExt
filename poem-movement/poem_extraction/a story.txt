a story

i used to be so sure
but i might just be immature
why do i do this again and again
never realizing the inevitability of the end
you used to say that you loved me
and i said it back
but you never knew
i always meant it more
and how could this possibly be love
if we never talk anymore
you lie and say you fell asleep
delegate me to someone else
so i don't know what to say anymore
because clearly these words
mean nothing to you
tell me what to do
because i just don't know anymore
