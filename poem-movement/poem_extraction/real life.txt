real life

i told her to come to the meadow
at exactly 6:30am, because
even though i knew she wouldn't
appreciate having to get up so early
she would be just curious enough to decide to come.
besides, i put a heart sticker on the letter.
when she got to the meadow
i knew she noticed the serenity
and calmness of the area. we could both
taste the fresh air and she could feel
the morning dewdrops on her feet
after all, she had worn slippers thinking
this would be no more than a morning picnic.
she then sees the red and white
checkered cloth in the middle of the meadow
as well as the old wicker basket on it and
the cute sleepy cat next to it and me
just sitting there waiting for her
as she ran to me i stood up
and we simply hugged for a few minutes
enjoying the peace of the meadow
eventually we sit down to eat and joke
laughing while watching the sun come up
when it starts to rise, i push the cat towards her
and he stands up and walks right to her
putting his paw on her leg asking to be picked up
so she does, she holds him like she would a baby
but then she notices something on his collar
something that wasn't there yesterday
it's a ring
as she slides it off the collar and sees the inscription
i get down on one knee
and as the sun comes up, she reads it
"Eunice, I Love You"
she looks at me, almost with tears in her eyes
and i ask her that question, that question of dreams
she already knows her answer
and she says it so quietly, it's almost a whisper, "yes"
