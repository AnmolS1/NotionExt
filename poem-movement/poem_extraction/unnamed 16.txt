unnamed 16

there are two types of love
there's the kind that you Þnd
in good morning texts and shy smiles
the kind that comes with
butterßies and stolen glances
the kind where
you laugh for no reason
and a smile is forever glued to your face
sweet, simple, honest, pure
and then there's
the kind that Þnds you
in 2 a.m. phone calls and the tears on your pillow
the kind that comes with
a war between your brain and your heart
the kind where
nothing makes you happier
and nothing makes you sadder
passionate, overwhelming, intense, daring and when it all comes crashing down
sodoyou
