leave me

the pain is    gone
leaving nothing in it 's absence
but still , he feels it
there's nothing real     anymore
the days fade into each other
as nights    become blurs of fantasy
what more can he do
but survive ?
living becomes      regret ,
death     becomes peace
months    have passed  .
his imagination is all that remains
when sanity , has    dissolved
and    grief , has turned to scars .
