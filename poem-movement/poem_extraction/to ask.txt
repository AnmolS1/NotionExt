to ask

not a single question
not for a droplet of hope
nor for an ounce of truth
and yet there he sat
a year too late
wondering why
the possibilities came in dreams
dreams he could no longer bear
the answer eluded him
just as his life was beginning
a life he knew
would be haunted forever
by one simple question
