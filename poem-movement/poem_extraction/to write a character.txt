to write a character

is to life another life
one must see through
another human's eyes
and love the way they love
with or without condition
but most importantly
one must feel their pain
for what are humans
if not the product of fear,
hatred, rage, anger
and all the other messy feelings inside?
it is through pain that we
connect
and live
and write
