an impossible love story

"why must we fall?"
he screams at the moon
as it shouts back at him
with unimaginable silence
everyone had told him so
we live in a cold, cruel world
he never believed them
he had that damned thing
hope
still knowing it would crush him
he held on as if he was
gripping a cliff
for he was in love
he had fallen so long ago
and never noticed
not until she smiled at him
and said those three
simple words
you know what they were
of course, she meant them
in her own
best-friend way
but he knew
he could never say them back
not because he wouldn't mean it
but because he would mean it
far more than she could ever
possibly imagine
