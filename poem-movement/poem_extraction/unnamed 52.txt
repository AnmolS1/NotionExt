unnamed 52

it is dif√ûcult to ascertain
the precise moment
at which i returned
into darkness.
all i know is
my heart emptied,
i couldn't move,
i couldn't breathe,
my mind scattered
across realms, and
i felt useless,
       unimportant,
       unloved,
       unnecessary,
and i simply embraced
the darkness.
