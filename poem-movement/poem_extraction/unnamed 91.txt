"What does love feel like?"
Like there's a button right in front of you that says, "Press here for free cookies". But 
every time you press it, a bird shits on your head, but you keep pressing it, and once in 
every 100 times, you get a cookie. And it's the best fucking cookie you've ever had. And 
while you're eating it, you realize you'll willingly get shit on 99 more times in hopes of 
getting another cookie. Then one day, the cookies stop coming.
