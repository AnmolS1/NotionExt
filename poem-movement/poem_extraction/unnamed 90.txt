unnamed 90

i keep trying to convince myself
i'm worth it
i have a purpose
and something good will happen
if i just wait
but today's gone
yesterday's gone
the day before that is gone
the last month?
the last year?
all goneand if nothing good has happened yet
then how likely is it
that something good will ever happen?
maybe it would be easier
to just give up
because now i know
i'm not worth it
