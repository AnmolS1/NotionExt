the burns we hide

i stare at the lighter on
and marvel at the small ßame
dancing around
without a care in the world
a perfect piece of chaos
and i wish i had that
that same carefree feeling
so i hold my arm out over the ßame
hoping thatthis feeling is tangible, that
this feeling is transferrable
but it's not
and all i'm left with
is another day
and another burn
