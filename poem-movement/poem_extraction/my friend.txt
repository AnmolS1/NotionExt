my friend

we laugh togetherand talk about everything
and nothing toono matter how bad or stupid
hilarious or incredible
so when you told me
how deeply you've been
hurting for so long
i was speechless
to say the least
even here as i write
words begin to fail
for nothing i know of
could possibly compare
what i do know is this
you are an awesome person
and you deserve to be
happyit will take time
as these things do
but you will Ãžnd her again
and while you may never
forget the heartbreaking
tragedies you've been
through
you will come to a peace
and soon enough
your smile will
light up the world
once again
