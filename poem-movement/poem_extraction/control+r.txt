control+r

it takes a while
for the sun to rise again
and for us to realize
that the sun has risen
again
the world will push on
as if nothing ever happened
but it will be different
new lives for each of us
new hopes and dreams
new people to share it with
but one cookie i hope
i'll never lose in the blinding
light of a new sun
is you
the sweetest, most amazing
caring and beautiful person
you helped light my way
when even the moon had left
sowhen the night ends
and the birds sing again
while the music plays once more
and life restarts
you will get the biggest fucking
hug
from me :)
(if thats ok with u)
