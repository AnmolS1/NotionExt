humanity

quite a trivial species
they enjoy primitive pastimes
spheres get kicked and thrown
alcohol gets drunk
and sugary foods are eaten
they pose quite little threat
to anyone except themselves
for at each other
they punch
they kick
they shoot
they kill
and yet,
many of them still learn to live
life as it should be lived
with love in their hearts
and kindness in their hands
they stretch their faces wide
and exhale in short bursts
when others speak ironically
they hold each other
wrapping arms around them
to indicate joy and happiness
they press their lips
onto each other's
in proof of love and passion
really they are quite endearing
always trying to be the best of all
and with such a short life span
some never Þnd their truth
but i hold the Þrm belief
that i've found my truth
for my truth
is quite simply
you
