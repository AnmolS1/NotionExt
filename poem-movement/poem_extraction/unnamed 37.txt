unnamed 37

I thought that I was getting better
That maybe I Ãžnally might be okay
But then I saw her
I saw her having fun
Smiling
LaughingAnd I realized
How little I matter
Not just to her
To everyone
Nobody cares
And if nobody cares
Then what am I doing
Still alive?
Why do I still try?
What is the point?
Wouldn't it all be so much
Easier
If I just said
Goodbye?
