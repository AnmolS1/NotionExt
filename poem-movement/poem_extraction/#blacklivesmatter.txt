#blacklivesmatter

suffering surrounds them
living with the fear of death every day
// add in abuse stuff
they do everything they can
but what can they do
when those who are meant to protect them
are against them
when those who are meant to be kind
are harmful
deadly to a point
where there is no coming back.
there is no change without necessity
people do not rise without purpose
each of us lives to help one another
so protest
revolt
create change
end the centuries of suffering
and be human.
