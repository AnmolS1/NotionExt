no words for the dead

the scars were nothing
the burns were nothing
they left behind no words
no words to describe them
and even now
over a year later
there's just no way
to describe it
the hurt and the pain
it's all resurfacing
these last few days
have been so difÞcult
trying to Þnd the words
words to help me
remember the good
remember my smile
but it feels gone
and i'm not sure it's coming back
