a fool's quest

the pursuit of knowledge
quite a mindless pastime
we learn in order to learn
and expect nothing in return
some learn to aid others
in their pursuit of knowledge
others learn to attain
the elusive power of control
but what is the point i ask
in learning for nothing
to further a nothingness
in an ultimately
inconsequential nothing
where nothing is worth anything
and yet
everything seems to be
worth something
what is the point?
