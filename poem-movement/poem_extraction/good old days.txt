good old days

i wish there was some way
for you to know you were
in the good old days
before you'd left them
because right now
the good old days
seem like they were
years ago
but decades down the line
maybe these might be
the good old days
but perhaps
that is the lesson here
to live each day
as if these will be your
good old days
