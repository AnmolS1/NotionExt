the railway

water rushes past
following it's path down
to some unknown terminus
over the rocks
past the trees
through the grass
heat pulls on eyes
and drips down the arms
as the mind calms
and the heart slows
he sees her again
hidden behind a tree, quietly
she beckons him forward
for miles he follows
watching the sun bend
and the moon stretch
the leaves fall
and the ice bites
still he cannot catch up
he continues on
knowing he will never catch up
he continues on
