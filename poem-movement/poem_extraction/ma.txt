mahappy birthday!

it's a cliche to say that there are no words
to express the gratitude i feel for you
because of course there are
"thank you"
but just this feel so
lackluster
so i'll continue
thank you for always picking up the phone
thank you for checking on me every day
thank you for all your advice
thank you for all of the your incredible food
thank you for everything you do for me
you've done so much for me
and for everyone you meet
for that, thank you
i hope that your day is perfect
and happy :)
happy birthday!
