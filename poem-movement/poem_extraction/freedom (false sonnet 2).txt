freedom (false sonnet 2)

13a small number for a class size
without fail, quite serene
and always quite wise
no book club could compare,
nor novice novelists neither
i know inspiration is somewhere
perhaps in a meme, a golden retriever?
what indeed is the purpose of life
if not to write and to love?
my friends, let go of this strife
your genius fits like a glove
i promise you, soon one day
we will all be more than okay
