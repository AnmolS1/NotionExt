a dance understood

they follow like the trail of a dress
falling into every nook and cranny
keeping track of them is
difficult
i wish i knew just how to force
them to conform
but instead i let them fly
they seem to know what to do
falling tighter into each other
catching one another's arms
some even merge into one
kissing and bringing new life
they describe to me
planets never heard
sounds never seen
light never tasted
i wish i could understand
just what they want to tell me
for these numbers dance
like cleopatra
as i am but a small-minded
toad
hoping to bring to us a number
to tell us all
the ultimate end of our own
that which we may never know
the final dance
