how to tell you're in love:
there's a lot of endless yearning
that won't be ful√ûlled
until they're in your arms
instead of your dreams
there's a lot of smiling and laughing
some tears too
just a whirlwind
of emotion
there's a lot of sleepless nights
either too in love
or too afraid
of what love is doing to you
there's a lot of heartache
when they leave
nothing will feel right
for a while
the bits and pieces of memories
that come back in waves
and wash over you
until you're drowning in them
