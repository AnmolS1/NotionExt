a future to be found

i may not know much
but i know a few things
the future is coming
unchangeable
and we don't know
how these days
will unfoldand yet
i want you in it
every single hour
every single minute
all i want to dois come back home
to you
but still
as much as i want
to believe you'll be there
i know
you left a long time ago
