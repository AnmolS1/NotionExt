unnamed 13

"But you seemed Þne?"
Ah, but see, there's that word "seemed". Yes, I may have "seemed" Þne, and yes there 
may be a smile on my face each passing day, or a wave hello in the halls; but I can 
guarantee you with every ounce of will in my being that there is absolutely nothing Þne 
about me. Seemed is a tricky word you see, because nothing is really ever what it 
seems to be.
