dream within a dream

it never occurred to me
that i'd make it this far
that life did indeed have a plan
but here i stand
or, i suppose, here i sit
considering each word
as carefully as i did 3 years ago
but now
rather than waiting for nothing
i wait for work to start
and for classes to begin
and it feels different
i feel ready
