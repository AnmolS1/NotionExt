lost to me

i could feel it.
you losing interest
as our 3am conversations
dwindledto 3 minute conversations
to no conversations
and that shine in your eyes
went awayi could feel it.
losing you
and it hurts so much
because all i want
is to know you
the real you
but what i do know
is that you
couldn't care less
about knowing me
