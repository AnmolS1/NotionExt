it's quite simple
to say that you're over someone
when you haven't seen them
in months
the real challenge
and the most dif√ûcult part
is to be able to
look them in the eye
hear their voice
smile
and say
"this is not what i want anymore"
 i used to think
it would be so easy
that i would be strong enough
but i couldn't
not yet
maybe not ever
