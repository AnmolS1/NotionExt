a feeling for which there is no word

beating heart
tapping Þnger
jumping knee
racing thoughts
Þnally going to see her
after so long
and then there she is
with someone else?
she's laughing
with himandholdinghis hand
andshe smiles
at himandher eyes
there's a spark
one i've never
seen before
jealous?
noi want her to be happy
anger?
noi could never be mad at her
sadness?
noshe's happy and soon
i will be toothere's millions of feelings out there
and none of them describe
the way i Felt for you
