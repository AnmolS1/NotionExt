a second chance

back to the beginning
every morning
a broken record
he knows he needs to move on
the day happens again
it drags along the branch
tears fall like raindrops
in stormy weather
onto his pillow at night
he stares at the streetlamp outside
and remembers her walking away
for the last time
back to the beginning
