fool me once

i agree it was my fault
for it was i who tripped
and fell so hopelessly
for you
all those years ago
but now we're here again
you
still smart and brave
and beautiful as ever
and me
still dumb and cowardly
and hopeless as ever
i just had to trip again
falling so helplessly
but i must ask
how could i not trip
how could anyone
not trip
after catching your eye
and quite simply
melting to liquid gold
