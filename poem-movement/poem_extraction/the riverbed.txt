the riverbed

a cool breeze flutters by as the sun rises
his first step echoes to let the world know
he is awake
and so begins, the perfect monday
after the first step must come a second
deeper into the mud and twigs
he continues to forge his path
throughout his tuesday
there was bound to be a misstep
he slips and with a forward splash
he frightens all those around him
those who will never come back
but still, it is only wednesday
now he tiredly pushes on
flailing and hoping for a savior
knowing he will not have one
determination fades
and he barely makes it through thursday
the pain becomes unbearable to live with
he has no other option but to stop
so he does, and lets the water break his fall
as he sinks to the riverbed he looks around
and sees the skeletons of the others
who attempted to cross this river and failed
but all he can think is
"what a terribly morbid way
to end a friday"
