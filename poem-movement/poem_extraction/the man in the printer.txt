the man in the printer

there's a man in my printer
he sits there quietly
eating inkday and night just
doing exactly what i tell him
he prints my projects
and labssometimes my homework
and never once
does he complain, but
sometimes he falls asleep
when i jolt him awake
with a quick restart
he begins working again
but sometimes i wonder
how he'll follow me
when i leave for college
