the importance of emptiness

i don't quite know how to fill this
empty space leaving me with a kiss
perhaps i could simply ask the swiss
or maybe i'll just reminisce
on the better times and with some bliss
i'll have a twix and feel the hiss
of your lovely lies
it's empty after all, isn't it?
no amount of wit
could put words into this split
these words i put down moonlit
watching the stars transmit
their life across the tar pit
that is our universe, unfit
to recommit
as love's hypocrite.
