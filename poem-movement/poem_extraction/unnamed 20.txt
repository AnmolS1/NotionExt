unnamed 20

Death would be a welcome escape from this hellish piece of crap world we call home. 
There is no hope for those smart enough to understand that there truly is no point in 
living a 30 second life where nobody is really happy, everybody simply fakes their smile 
and goes about their life pretending they know what they're doing and hoping that the 
future holds more in store for them than this small, insigniÞcant nothingness. But that's 
all we really are, that's all anyone really is, an insigniÞcant speck of dust on a small ball 
spinning around a tiny piece of light in a dark, cold universe.
