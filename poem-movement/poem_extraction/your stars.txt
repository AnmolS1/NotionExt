your stars

there are billions of stars
up in the night sky
and there's still so much left
to learn about
each and every single one
but how could i possibly
focus on
such a pointless beauty
when you are here
standing in front of me
completely pure
and entirely true
and nothing less
for all i've ever
really wanted
is to be just one star
in your night sky
