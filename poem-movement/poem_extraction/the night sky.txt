the night sky

you asked me once
what futures could look like
and i, unwilling to divulge
the truth,
gave you some
bullshit answer
so here it is
even if it's too late
it's the truth
you are going to be incredible
beyond amazing one day
signing books in New York
with a name on the bestseller's
happy as hell
you'll be a star
and for me?
it's quite simple
you'll be my star
