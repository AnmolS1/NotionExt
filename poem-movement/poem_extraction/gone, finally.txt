gone, Þnally

with a smile on his face
knowing he Þnally
put a smile on Hers
he walked out
in the end it was really quite simple
he put one foot in front of the other
for it was their last day and
without wanting tobut knowing he had to
he lefthe almost didn't go
in fact it was Her smile
that made him want to stay
but thingsthings were complicated
yes, they always would be
but this time
things were different
