leftovers

what you think matters not
nothing you've ever felt is real
nothing you've ever seen is real
the only reality we have is unknown
what can we detect
with our own senses
that is not the extraneous information
put in place to distract us
from our own lives?
the bits and pieces we call memories
the ideas and concepts we call existence
all are nothing
what we exist in is an impossibility
a reality that is unreal
what specimens of scent will be left
when there are no noses to smell?
what shred of objectivity will be left
when eyes are no longer connected to brains?
what waves of sound will be left
when ears bleed out, shrivel?
what form of deliciousness will be left
when tongues are but slices of the past?
what iota of material will be left
when fingers are parceled back to hell?
what fragments of memory will be left
when minds have melted
into nothingness?
at the end, the only importance is reality
nobody knows what it looks like
nor what it exists as
because when we become
nothing but rotten leftovers
that is when our reality
has truly collapsed.
