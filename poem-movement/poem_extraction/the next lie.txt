the next lie

i was Þnally okay
Þnally close to what you may call
happiness
and i knew
with those 3 simple words
i could bring my entire world
downso i left them alone
butthey were still there
and as the last day rolled around
they were still there
i wanted to say them
i wanted to just let them free
and yet, i couldn't
with my Þnger hovering on send
i just couldn't
and so another year began
with a lie
