unnamed 44

the worst crying
is when you're lying in bed
with your hand
over your mouth
so you don't make any noise
the tears are running
onto your pillow
and your heart's breaking
and you're thinking
of everything
that made you like this
and your other hand
is on your heart
or your stomach
because they both hurt just as much
