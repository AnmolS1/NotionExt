losing you

we don't talk anymore
not after all my mistakes
and all your patience
so when you exclaimed at 2am
how happy you were
and how good of a night it had beeni was curious
but my curiosity and my imagination
are my most harmful traits
for i could only imagine
someone else making you laugh
putting a smile on your face
keeping you happy
when all i wanted to dowas be that person
