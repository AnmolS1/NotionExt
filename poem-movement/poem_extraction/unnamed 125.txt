unnamed 125

am i the only one?
the only one who lies awake at night.
the only one who sits
on the ÃŸoor of their room,
in a small corner,
thinking about how much
they'd love to die.
you see, dying doesn't scare me anymore.
in fact, i welcome it.
i've stared Death in the face
and watched his sorry ass crawl away.
it's not dying that scares me
not at allit's life.
living is the real hell.
living scares me more than anything
death has to offer.
all of this pain
building up for years
hasn't gone away
everyone who said it would, lied.
the pain of living
of being alive
of having to exist
is quite too much to bear.
perhaps it would be simpler
to just give up
