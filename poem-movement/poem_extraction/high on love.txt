high on love

it's difÞcult to say just how much
i've fallen for you
but still i know
and still i can say
this is more than a simple phase
for every time you smile
it's as if the sun has come out
after a dark week of rain
and every time you laugh
you're nothing short of gorgeous
but you still shy away
i just wish i had the chance
to show you
what the other ones did wrong
how they all blew it
and i don't care what they say
fuck all the other Þsh in the sea
i was made for you
and you were made for me
