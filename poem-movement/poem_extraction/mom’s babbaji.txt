mom's babbaji

His sharp suit and a golf cap
walking stick and polished shoes
a straight back into his 80s
an elegant man
That's how I remember Babbaji
His dhoti and kurta
white as the moon
crisp as paper
glasses shiny and gleaming
walking around as though he
owned the place
That's how I remember Babbaji
His work space spotless and organized
books in perfect order
his class, his elegance, his gentle demeanor
That's how I remember Babbaji
The best of all Grandpas
his stories were funny
he loved cars
he loved food
and he loved to feed me fish
such a picky eater like me
yet I enjoyed eating out of his plate
That's how I remember Babbaji
And then there he was
he looked just as alive, lying in that frame
the somber news shattered my heart
I wasn't ready, I wanted more time
and I still wish I had more time
with him
