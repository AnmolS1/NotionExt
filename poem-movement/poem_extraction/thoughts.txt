thoughtsi can't stop thinking

these thoughts Ãžll my mind
completely unrelenting
i don't know why
and so they seem to exist
entirely without purpose
but how is this possible
for if there is a purpose
to these unordered thoughts
i would be inclined
to acknowledge their existence
and yet i know
purposelessness is but
an indication of existence
not a mere state of mind
and therefore
nothing has purpose
and therefore
nothing exists
