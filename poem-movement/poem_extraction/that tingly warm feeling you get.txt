that tingly warm feeling you get

you know the one
when they do the thing
and it's not weird
because it's just them
that person you've known
for so damn long that y'all
might as well have never
stopped talking
it's cold sunday mornings
in a blanket with coffee and hulu
it's mom's homemade paneer
after an exhausting, sad day
it's hearing "you got the job"
after hundreds of rejections
it's falling asleep on the couch
and awaking with those lines all over
it's comfort
it's relaxed
it's love
