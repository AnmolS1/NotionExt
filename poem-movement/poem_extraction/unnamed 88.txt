unnamed 88

Some have it, and wish they didn't
Others lack it, and wish they had it
Some believe it is everlasting within each individual
Many are convinced it erodes with the passing of time
It is suspected to uncover the inexperience,
Making it an unfavorable quality at times
But, its existence lies in our hands
As it is intangible
Merely de√ûned by our perception
