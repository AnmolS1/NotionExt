unnamed 6

It has been hours.
The pieces are scattered
All over the ßoor, like
grains of sand.
I get up and beginTo slowly gather them up.
Piece by piece,
Shard by shard,
And yet, they seem to be appearing
Far faster than I can pick them up.
Months have passed.
I am still picking up the pieces.
People ask if I am okay.
I want to say no, I want
To scream
And shout,
"HELP ME."
But all that comes out,
"I'm Þne."
It's been a year now.
I've almost gotten all the pieces.
As I pick up the last piece,
and the last tear falls,
and I tape the object together,
I Þnd a hole in the once-beautiful object.
A deep dark abyss
That shall never be Þlled
The way it used to be.
And I realize,
this is what they meant,
by a broken heart.
