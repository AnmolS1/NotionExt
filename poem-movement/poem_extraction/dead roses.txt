dead roses

i wonder why we compare love to roses
some say that
love is like a rose
in that it starts off fresh
a little thorny
but still smooth
silky
beautifuljust like her
but time goes on
and roses wilt
so does love
i disagree
for with the right person
and the right reasons
i believe
love is more like pure energy
never destroyed
always there
it's just harder to Ãžnd sometimes
and sometimes it takes longer
butif you've found love
with the right person
it's only a matter of time
