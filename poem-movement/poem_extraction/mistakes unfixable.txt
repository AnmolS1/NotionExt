mistakes un√ûxable

it doesn't seem to stop
especially when i'm happy
feeling like maybe i'm ready
to move on and forward
no matter how hard i work
no matter how hard i try
no matter how much i want to
i can't seem to stop making mistakes
and i know
"mistakes are the key to learning"
"mistakes are how you get better"
"mistakes are necessary for growth"
bullshit
all i wantis to be a good person
to not make people
feel like shit
to not bethe shit person
that i exist as
because truly that's all i am
a piece of shit meant for nothing
