unnamed 27

As the nights grew longer
and the days grew shorter,
I thought to myself
"I'm Þne, I don't need help"
As my appetite grew slim
and my eyes went dim,
I thought to myself
"I'm Þne, I don't need help"
As the music became dull
and my life became null,
I though to myself
"I'm Þne, I don't need help"
But now
Now as I lay here dying,
I close my eyes and
I think to myself
"Maybe I was wrong"
But it's too late.
