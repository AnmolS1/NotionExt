a reaper

our one true friend
simply existing at times
between the hell we call life
and the forgiveness we call death
helping us through
through to whatever comes next
through our loneliest moment
i met my reaper yesterday
after the blood ebbed away
he seemed quite nice
all he wanted to dowas help me move on
and so far
i haven't felt that anywhere else
