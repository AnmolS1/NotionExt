a simple text

it was the simplest of things
just a text
at 11:02 pm you asked me
"Hey u up?"
and againmy heart raced
my mind melted
and that was when i knew
it didn't matter how long
it had been or how
i was Ãžnally over you,
you would always
have your own room
in my heart
because
to put it quite simply
i missed you
