false courage

he finally did it
gathered the torn pieces of his heart
taped them together
piece by piece
he knew it was all his fault
but their deaths left him as a shell
no more love to give
and no capacity to receive it
but still
all he had by the end
was a poorly stitched heart
so he locked it away
in a meticulous prison
filled with his self-doubt
his self-hate
all the scars he gave himself
the dreams of his own finality
filled his every waking moment
he longed for the end
after all
what else was there
to long for anymore?
i never could really answer that
even when i was alive
