optimism

slowly it blooms
the petals spread and their color
is like nothing ever seen before
like silk sheets on a perfect morning
and a gentle kiss from your love
like pancakes for dinner
drowned in sweet syrup
but
like all other things
this too must die
complete its life
finish its time
live
only to stop
