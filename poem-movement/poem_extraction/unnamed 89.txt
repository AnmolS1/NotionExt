unnamed 89

there are times when i wonder
if it's really worth it
to keep going
to keep trying
to push harder
even though i know
i will only fall again
i will always fail
because that is just who i am
but then i remember
the tears on my mother's face
when she discovered
all the feelings i had kept hidden
all these years
the confusion in my sisters' words
as they tried to understand
why i went to a doctor's of√ûce
just to talk, every week
the worry in my friends' texts
as they made sure i was still alive
and i remember
it is worth it
i matter
all of us matter
everyone has worth
everyone has something
worth giving
and i think it's important
that we all remember that
