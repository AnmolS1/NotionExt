brown eyed girl

they say the eyes are a window
into the soul
and if that is true
Her soul is an incredible complexity
based upon quiet simplicity
for Her eyes are so beautiful
they boggle the mind
and leave me speechless
in Her eyes i can see it
what happiness feels like
what purity is like
what beauty looks like
it was the re√üection
of the world from her eyes
that showed me hope
and innocence
and love
