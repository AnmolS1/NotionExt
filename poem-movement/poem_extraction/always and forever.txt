always and forever

less than half a decade
merely 5% of our lives
it shouldn't have been possible
but we became so close
so extraordinarily close in
such extraordinarily small time
i know you are going on
to live your life
and i will too
but know that i will miss you
i will cherish the memories
of us
screaming as we do
doughnuts in a parking lot
cramming last minute
for that terrible english test
eating our hearts out
with horrific cafeteria food
it's a shame
our last year together
has been vanquished
but still we stand
and together
we continue to rise
