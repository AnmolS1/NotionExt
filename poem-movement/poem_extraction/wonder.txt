wonder

all futures that are known
are past
why we must do all we can
to gain that tiny glimpse
into a future best left
to our imagination
escapes and boggles the mind
if we must take a glimpse
gaze
gander
at our futures
all it takes
is a simple look
over the shoulder
at the blazing trail
of destruction we've left
behind us
