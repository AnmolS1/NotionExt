to admit

things are different now
you respond less and less
our 5 hour conversations
and deep 3am talks
shifted into simple
5 minute greetings
and shallowed short
3 minute talks of shows
i miss it
talking to you for forever
and just being there
with you
and so i must admit
it may be time
to let you go
