whoreson

i love you
like the sun loves a break in the clouds
like a caterpillar loves a leafy leaf
like an insomniac loves his coffee
like batman loves his bat mobile
like nothing i've ever loved before
because you are different
someone incredible
some otherworldly gift
who was
for some reason dropped
directly into my life
you aren't just my rock
you are my whole boulder
always the grounding mechanism
always the most lovely
calming
presence
the laughs we have are unforgettable
and the nights we spend talking
entrancing
i don't know much, dear whoreson
but i know this
that i will never have to doubt
whether or not i love you
because there's no question
it's quite simply
true
