another point in time

nearing the end now
he knew there was no point
no point in continuing this
charade they had perpetuated
hoping that something would
someday work out
her time was
nonexistent
his mind was
discombobulated
she kept telling him
that it would be ok
that she would find a minute
that she would finally have time
that she would stop working
that she would remember him
that she still loved him
a farce
meaningless
pointless
even now
as he tells her that he needs
but a minute of her time
to finally talk
to finally end whatever
falsity they had created
she simply ignores him
whether it is to continue
the lie they both live
or to keep the end far away
he does not know
but does it matter?
the end is near
and so this story of theirs
comes to a final close
