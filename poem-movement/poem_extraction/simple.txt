simple

the simplicity of the word simple
is not in the simplicity of itself
rather it lies in the complexity
of simpleness
for however simple simplicity may be
the complexity of simple is far more
simple than it may sound because
calling simple a simple adjective
is akin to calling ludicrous
a ludicrous adjective
it simply doesn't work
the simplicity of simple
and its complexity in being
is quite dif√ûcult to describe
in a mere poem
and yet i've
endeavored to do so
