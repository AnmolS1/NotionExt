may 13

it's an odd sort of thing to have known
my favorite day of the year
it's not my birthday
or christmas
or the end of school even
it's nothing you might ever guess
but she knows
she knows what that day meant to me
she knows how much i loved her
that was of course
a very long time ago
for now i have no favorite day
at least not to you all
but to usit shall forever remain
our favorite day
