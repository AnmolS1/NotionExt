restarts

every once in a while
the world allows us a chance
to begin anew
sometimes we consider ourselves
perfectly fine
and we decline this opportunity
in expectancy of the ever-elusive
gratitude that life shall never
give us
but sometimes we must breathe
allow ourselves to accept
the inevitability of our mortality
and restart
