Þrsts

i've always found Þrsts
in a friendship to be
quite awesome
the somewhat awkward introduction
that always seems to elucidate a laugh
the hopeful asking for a number
with that shy and hopeful smile
the formal, apprehensive Þrst text
so polite and yet so demanding
the Þrst meme
forever remembered as the beginning
the Þrst 1am talk
leaving at least one with a new outlook on life
the list could go on for pages
but simply put....
they all seem to fuse
into something
so beautifully real
and so abstract
that after a while
i think we all start
taking those Þrsts
for granted
