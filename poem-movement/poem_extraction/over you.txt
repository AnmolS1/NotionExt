over you

i knew i was Þnally there
Þnally able to feel that clear air
when you hit me up at 10:30pm
and my brain didn't just fall into mayhem
i didn't really feel that excitement
i didn't really feel that ßash of lightnin
but here i should enlighten
of course i didn't stay silent
of course i didn't make my words uninvitin
but i didn't feel a requirement
there just wasn't an assignment
i simply Þnally felt free
free of you, and that i can guarantee
