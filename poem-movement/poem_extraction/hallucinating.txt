hallucinating

twas but another summer
and i had made it through
falling through insanity
lost, away from you
no longer does the sun rise
there is only the night
so here i am missing you
breathing in the moonlight
and it's true, i do love you
so how can i let you go
staring at your headstone
i can only watch as ßowers grow
it's becoming hard to think
the tears now rolling down
i Þnd myself falling into the ßowers
just trying my best to not drown
