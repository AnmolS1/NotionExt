peoplethey can be quite... interesting

often disappointing
and rarely surprising
their predictability and
swift changes in face
don't even begin
to make up for their utter
foolishness
and a complete lack of
basic decency
and common courtesy
in fact most people
use one another as rocks
to climb upon on their journey
towards the peak
of their "unique" mountain
never will they reveal the
horrendous acts of
what could only be described as
devilish incompetence
for that is in and of itself
the tomfoolery that shows
just how completely illogical
they truly are
