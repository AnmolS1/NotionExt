uniquely

nothing else mattered then
what else could he say?
after months of waiting
thinking he would have to wait
for the rest of his life
of course he couldn't give up
this was no time to end it
so he opened his eyes to hers
and his life and hers
immersed themselves
in each other
as he finally said
"i do"
