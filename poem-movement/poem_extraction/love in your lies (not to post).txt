love in your lies (not to post)

you used to call me handsome
tell me i deserved to be loved
make me feel calm
and peace
you used to play with my hair
my head in your lap
and my heart in your hands
a heart you broke
you used to say you'd never leave
that you'd never be able to
that you loved me too much
to see me in pain
i guess that last part was true
because after you left
you could never look me in the eyes again
