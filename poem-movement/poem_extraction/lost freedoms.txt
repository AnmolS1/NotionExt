lost freedoms

he still remembers her
her smiles steal away in his dreams
and the nights lose their gleam
every waking moment is filled with empty
while every breath, he just tries to keep steady
but then food lost its taste
the memory of her lips could never be erased
he heard her laugh everywhere he went
and looked for her eyes in everyone he met
truth be told, he couldn't take it any longer
every day he felt just a little smaller
that's why he's not here anymore you see
he finally learned how to be free
