unnamed 31

Who am I?
well, I am quite simply
a failure.
with dropping grades,
with bad habits,
with feelings I know
will come back to haunt me
one day soon.
i am useless.
i let all those around me down
at some point,
or i push them away.
there is but one reason
to keep going,
and even that
is fading quickly.
with nothing buta Ãžre burning up my soul,
a song playing in my heart,
and an empty
yet oh so chaotic mind,
i am nothing.
