breathe

a lunge forth
and a drop straight down
the boat dips it's bow
into the bluest blue
i've ever seen
the waves
they don't crash
they don't jerk
the waves roll
over each other and under me
the waves roll like sheets
on the most comfortable ocean bed
the sun beats down
on bare skin
and i must squint
to see the island
while the water falls up my legs
that hang from the edge
i've felt many things in this life
pain and ecstasy
joy and heartbreak
never have i felt this
peace
in such vastness
where the only sound is that of
the cool water
and dolphins swim under me
i see peace
and finally i understand it
