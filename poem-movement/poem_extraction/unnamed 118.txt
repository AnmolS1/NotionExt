unnamed 118

you return like autumn,
like the fall of crisp leaves
the calm yet brisk wind
the perfectly simple balance
of light and darkness
the beautiful and wondrous
reminder of the permanence
that is our impermanence
the entirety of my world
the one and only thing
i cannot live without
and I fall every time.
