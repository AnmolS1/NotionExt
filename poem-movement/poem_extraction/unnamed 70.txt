unnamed 70

the trees always go with the breeze
whichever direction the wind takes them
the leaves just
let it happenand the branches
hold the trees together
but sometimes
the wind pushes too hard
and the branches
that hold the trees together
break
and i wonderif we are like trees
trying to hold it together
but then something happens
our hearts break
someone dies
or something else
and the wind just
breaks us
and all that's left of us
at the endare broken branches
and hopeless hearts
