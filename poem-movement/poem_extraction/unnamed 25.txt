unnamed 25

You don't get it yet. You're the only one I have my eyes open for, the only one who truly 
sparks an interest inside of me in a way no one else can. You're the only one I go on 
thinking about through out the day, even if it leaves me in a haze at least I know that I'm 
in a great one. You are that person who I dream about when I'm sleeping in my bed with 
a thousand crickets making sounds around me. And it's your voice that brings me back 
to reality, knowing that I have someone as special as you by my side to help me get 
through my bad days. there isn't anyone else out there that can make me feel the way 
that you do, that can affect my emotions the way you can. You're a different kind of 
person, one that I fell in love with and one that I plan on falling in love with more and 
more as each and every day passes.
Only you have that effect on me. Only you can make my heart skip a beat just because 
your name ßashed up on my phone screen. Only you can make thousands of butterßies 
appear in my stomach when we talk. Only you can make me feel like the happiest 
person in the world by hearing your laughter. I am completely, utterly, foolishly in love 
with only you.
