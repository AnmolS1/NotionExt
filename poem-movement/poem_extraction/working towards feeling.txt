working towards feeling

there's never been a doubt
he loves to work
the feeling of knowing
that he knows even more
that he can do even more
that is his high
nothing beats that
working all night
powering through stress
an infinite loop of
checks on his to-do list
days spent at his desk
nothing beats that
sleep deprivation
caffeine addiction
anxiety
depression
nothing beats that
right?
