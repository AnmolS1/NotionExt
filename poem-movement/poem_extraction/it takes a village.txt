it takes a village

i knew as i walked in
that this would be nothing
quite like an ordinary education
the excitement was palpable
the students were intelligent
the teachers were funny
everything was perfect
i could see in its originality
the endless opportunities
the incredible friendships
the proud parents
the happy students
and i could feel in its totality
the homeliness
of knowing these people
my people
