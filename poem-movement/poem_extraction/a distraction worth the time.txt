a distraction worth the time

you've been nothing but distracting
keeping a leader from his people
Ãžlling his head with dreams
dreams of a future that can't
possibly be.
and he knows this.
but he lets you.
because for all the horrible
crap you put him through
and all the terrible
shit you will put him through
he still loves you.
