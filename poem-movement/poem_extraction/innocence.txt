innocence

i saw a baby today
it was the cutest little thing
with its chubby hand
in its smol mouth
and its big eyes
full of hopefull of wonderstaring right at me
i wasn't sure what to say
so i simply stared back
and slightly smiled
and it was good
i realized that sometimes
it is enough
to simply acknowledge
another's existence
for all we really need sometimes
is for someone to look
and say hey
you're here
you're important
you matter
to me
