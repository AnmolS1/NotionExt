when?an apple breaks free from the branch

the tree struggles to hold together
while the wind blows recklessly
and the rain falls relentlessly
the sun is invisible
behind clouds that bring darkness
the lamppost yearns for a break
but drearily it continues
you see, it has been told to do so
there is no incentive
and there is no hope
but still it continues
