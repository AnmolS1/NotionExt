you are not here
just to Ãžll space
or to be a background character
in someone else's movie
consider this:
nothing would be the same
if you did not exist
every place
you have ever been
and everyone
you have ever met
would be different
without you
we are all connected
and we are all affected
by the decisions
and even the existence
of those around us
