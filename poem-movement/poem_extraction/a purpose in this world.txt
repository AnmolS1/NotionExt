a purpose in this world

our worth can be determined
contrary to popular belief
by taking a mere blade
and allowing it to do
it's job
as you are laid down
for the final time
they will say
"He was a profound writer"
or perhaps
"His bargaining skills were unchallenged"
maybe even
"He was such a good person"
unfortunately
the process is irreversible
so choose wisely
because you may never
choose again
