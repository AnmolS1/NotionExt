something remains amiss

he doesn't miss her
he misses the memories
he misses the late nights
eating their hearts out at chick fil a
he misses the quiet afternoons
studying in their rooms together
he misses the early mornings
falling asleep on facetime with her
he misses the way she made him feel
when he felt like he could
do anything
solve any problem
cure any disease
be anyone
he misses
when he felt
      loved
