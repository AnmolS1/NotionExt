existing

i know we don't talk anymore
i know you must hate me
for all i've done
i know you might be happier
without me
but i just need to say
i'm sorry
for everything i've done
and everything i will ever do
i know that all i can do
is exist
i know that i don't matter
i know that i make no difference
but i don't care
if all i ever do
is exist at your side
so this is me
saying sorry
hoping you might say something
hoping you might not hate me
hoping you might simply
forgive me
