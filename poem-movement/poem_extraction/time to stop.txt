time to stop

the plate never empties
still i am force-fed
piles upon piles of this
but
"you should be grateful"
"think about every kid
who would kill to be where you are"
"just put your head down and work"
the wheel turns for naught
the motions slow
and my mind tears
my eyes burn with the hope
of a tear
but i ran out long ago
