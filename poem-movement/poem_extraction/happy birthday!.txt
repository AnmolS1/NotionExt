happy birthday!

even from here, i can feel your love.
it envelops me and runs deep,
as does my appreciation for you.
so thank you for all that you do
all the love you love us with
all the prayers you bless us with
all the nurture you raise us with.
this notebook is a small token
of my love for you,
it's blank pages are your canvas
to paint with your colorful words.
i hope you'll have fun
writing your heart out
into your wonderful poetry.
happy birthday mom :)
for a mother,
as incredible as she is kind,
from a son,
as loved as he is grateful
