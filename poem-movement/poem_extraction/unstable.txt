unstable

the great blue surrounds my head
my breath has left my lungs
my eyes no longer see
nor do my ears hear
in effect, everything is leaving
and yet somehow
it could be that everything is arriving
for as this bluish hell encapsulates me
my mere existence is enough
enough to keep me going
right?
