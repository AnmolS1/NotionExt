my tattered sweater

that old red sweater
was 4 sizes too large
5 years ago
soon it became 1 size
quite too bigand now it Ãžts perfectly
i dread the day
i will have to let it go
because every time
i put on that sweater
i feel like a child again
curious about the world
always ready to learn
loving without bounds
so pure hearted and true
i used to wonder
what would happen to me
when that sweater is gone?
will i remain myself?
or will i change?
i had one main goal
to write an ode to that sweater
the day i had to let it go
so here i am now
writing
