too soon

i'm not ready this time
boredom usually comes quickly
but this is my life now
i'm not ready to leave it yet
the small shrubs
housing jumpy rabbits
the quiet restfulness of campus
in dewy mornings
walking back from the library
at 2 in the morning
half dead with coffee in hand
the smell of the dining halls
a potluck of terrible food
and the people
everyone their own unknown
thousands just living here
learning and growing
giving to themselves and others
hoping
i wish i knew for what
