unnamed 102

i want to give up;
i'm done with myself
but no matter how depressed i am,
no matter how much it's killing me,
i can't leave because i care too much,
i know this would destroy my friends,
so i take this pain, i've chosen to smile
although i'm dying inside in the hope
the people i love don't become depressed
