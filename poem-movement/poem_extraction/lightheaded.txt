lightheaded

there's no time to stop
to take in the beautiful blue skies
or the softness of my blanket
not even the melting delight of brownies
there's 2 days of work
then 2 hours of sleep
and 2 minutes to eat
before hitting repeat
sometimes i close my eyes
for just 2 seconds
and let go of it all
for that quiet peace
