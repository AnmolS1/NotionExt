unnamed 26

do not tell me
not to kill myself
because you love me
and i matter to you
and you'll miss me,
i'm only a person that
you knew for a few
years back in school.
and when you're grown,
and have a family
and a life of your
own, you won't even
remember my name.
you won't remember
who i wasor that you "missed"
me so much.
