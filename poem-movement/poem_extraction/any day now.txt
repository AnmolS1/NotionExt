any day now

we aren't friends anymore
i thought you wanted to be but
you ran away the first chance you had
so now i waste away my days wondering
what did i do wrong?
was it really you?
or did you finally see me as i see myself?
i don't sleep anymore
i lie awake in bed for hours
every damn night forcing my eyes open
because i know that if i sleep
if i let these eyes fall
every minute of my dreams
will be about you
maybe one day
i'll be able to sleep again
without you plaguing my mind
maybe one day
i'll finally be over you
and take a breath
without thinking of you
noit's not plausible
not realistic at all
you've taken up more room in my heart
than myself
and not a day goes by
that i don't wake up and check my phone
hoping that you've said something
anything
i still don't know why you left
and i wish i knew
because maybe that would help me
stop pushing myself to the brink
get out of my own head
and finally let my heart mend
