the shy shadow

i've made a friend
he's a quiet silhouette
and he doesn't talk much
but he's almost always there
no matter what happens
i can always talk to him
sometimes he leaves
but all i have to do
is turn on a light
and there he is again
he's the most loyal person
you could ever hope to meet
there was one time
when he consoled me
to let me know everything
would soon be all right
and as i poured my heart out
a tear rolled down his cheek
but now we stand here
in the bloody kitchen
as i tip toe around the dead bodies
i notice in the corner of my eye
the silhouette
but this time
he's holding something
