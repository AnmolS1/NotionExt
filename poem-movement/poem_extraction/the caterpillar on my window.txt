the caterpillar on my window

it's difÞcult to continue writing now
when so much has happened
the hurt and confusion far outweigh
the words i know how to use
but here i stare at the outside world
from the comfort of my blanket
and drowning in my music
there's something on my window
as i inch closer it begins to inch too
it's a caterpillar
small and still quite hungry
it reminds me of her
the one who could light up a room
with her mere presence
who was never lost for words
or a smile to share with her friends
who showed me what it truly meant
to be in love
so there it Þnally is
perhaps these words might never
come out again as eloquently or as
hopefully as they once used to
for this is me beginning anew now
and yet as i deign to begin
i must also go forth and end
goodbye my friends
until next time
