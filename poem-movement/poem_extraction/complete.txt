complete

paper is everywhere
in places so odd
one should question how it got there
the writing is indecipherable
the bed is still unmade
books lay open
one has remnants
of a chocolate touch
paper plates lie astray
peppered with crumbs
the only light in the room
comes from the monitor's glow
and there he lay
in the midst of his own chaos
sound asleep
