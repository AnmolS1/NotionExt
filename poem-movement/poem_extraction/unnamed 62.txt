depression is like if one day you started to lose both your sense of taste and your ability 
to feel full. you don't know why, but everything you eat tastes like mashed potatoes and 
nothing you eat is satisfying. you keep eating because you must eat to live, but the 
effort that it takes to prepare food is taxing and there is no longer any pay off. you just 
know it will taste like mashed potatoes. you just know that you will still be hungry. so you 
stop bothering with seasonings. then you stop bothering to use the ingredients you used 
to like. then you start to wonder what the point of eating is because there is no payoff. 
you still feel hungry and you're sick of the taste and you don't know if you will ever enjoy 
food again and you don't know why this is happening. if someone comes up to you and 
asks, "well have you tried spicing your food? using different ingredients? eating foods 
you used to love?" it isn't necessarily helpful because the reason you stopped doing all 
that in the Ãžrst place is that everything... tasted... like mashed... potatoes.
