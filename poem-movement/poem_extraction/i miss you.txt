i miss you

i thought we were immune
we'd been through heaven and hell
through fire and water
and i was never good enough for you
i knew that
but for some reason you refused
to accept it
you never let me go
so of course,
all it took
was a little time
they say infections spread
they contaminate everything around them
destroying every last bit
of whatever good was left
it never occurred to me
the only possible way
to contaminate us
was me
