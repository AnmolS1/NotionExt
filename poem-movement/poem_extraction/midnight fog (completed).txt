midnight fog (completed)

reach into the closet
drag that jacket on
even 4 years later
her laugh still lingers
on it's collar
as he sinks into the bed
her cold fingers
pull his chin up
just a little
he can picture her face
smiling at him
a minute or so passes
before he remembers
the sound of the car
crushing against a tree
