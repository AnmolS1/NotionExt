it is not us that needs time to heal
it is the life within
the belief in who we are
at the very center of our heart
where they once took root
after all, love is simple
a piece of your heart given
and in return a piece of another's
but what can we do
when theirs refuses to leave
and instead locks itself in
keeping our own life hostage?
