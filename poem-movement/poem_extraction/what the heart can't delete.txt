what the heart can't delete

i keep trying to forget
to simply leave it behind
to begin anew without worry
but how can i possibly do so
when all i can think about
is how you broke me
you talk to me now
as if nothing was ever wrong
you came back into my life
as if you never left
you speak with a smile
as if you never took mine away
and i let you
because no matter what you did
i could never forget
the laughs we shared
the inside jokes, now old
the 2am conversations about life
the hope we instilled in each other
the friendship we once shared
all of thatreplayed in my mind
for months
and the mind simply replays
what the heart can't delete
