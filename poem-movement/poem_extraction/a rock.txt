a rock

life is but the weathering of a rock
taking years to perfect
sometimes a large part will chip
and life will be misshapen for a while
but eventually
it'll become a simple ball
evenly rounded everywhere
clear and smooth
or at least
that's what i tell myself
but on nights like these
who's to say really?
