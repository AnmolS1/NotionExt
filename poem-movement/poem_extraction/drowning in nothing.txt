drowning in nothing

how could i possibly be drowning
when there's nothing to be drowning in?
and why is the answer so simple
yet so complicated?
i'm drowning in the nothingness she left
when she tore me apart
with the simplest of words
that had the pain of a thousand broken dreams
behind them.
dreams of a happy, ful√ûlling future
dreams of a love, far more real
than what they show in movies
or in books.
it has been two years
and still i cannot help but wonder
what was it that made me
not good enough?what was it that created this spiral?
a spiral in which i'm constantly falling
farther and farther until suddenly
nothingand all i am is
simply, confusingly
and entirely
drowning in nothing
