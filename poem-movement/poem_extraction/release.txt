release

there is no instruction in a purge
only delight in having left it behind
and yet none benefit from this delight
who am i to say which is best?
after all, i am but an inexperienced
toddler
from the perspective
of this world
but still i delight in lacking instruction
the aim is not to inform growth
but to grow myself
