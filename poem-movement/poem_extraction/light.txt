light

the colors seemed brighter that day
the same dull blue of his glasses
turned to sky blues
shades of iridescent light
visible only to his pupils
why they were brighter was a secret
known only to him
to his memories
this was not just a new day
for him
this was a new life
free from strife
and this new life
he would not waste
for the moon's goodbyes
had taken his pain with it
and with the sun
he had woken up again
