living a life 

the material universe
can be quite overrated
at times
we work for new toys
new phonesnew cars
new houses
never considering
what it might end up doing
to our lives
our lifestyles
our health
our mindset
we must always take a minute
to just breathe at the beginning
of each day and enjoy
the wondrous simple fact
that we exist
