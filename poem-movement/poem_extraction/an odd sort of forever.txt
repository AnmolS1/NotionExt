an odd sort of forever

i wanted to tell You
just how much
i truly fell for You
but that chance was taken
when someone else
decided to paraphrase
my feelings
so here it is now
far too late
but hopefullystill meaningful
i fell for You as
petals from a ßower
teardrops off a cheek
snowßakes on a road
rain from the clouds
stars on the meadow
waves onto the shore
leaves from the trees
and the sun
into the nightand i wish
i could've told You before
but i'm here now
letting You know
what should've been said
long agoto You
the only one who could ever
truly make me enjoy
the thought of forever
