writer's block

what is our life
if not an illusion of what was
and a lie of what will bethese days seem to pass by
without care and without hope
i know not of anything
that puts dents in our souls
more than this life
for as the wind passes over
the rocks of our souls and minds
it only seems to create edges
more jagged than before
and the smooth curves ßatten
as our hearts shatter
and we Þnally sleep
through our own eternities
