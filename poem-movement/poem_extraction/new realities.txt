new realities

so here we are
all set up and nowhere to go
i wish i knew what to do now
but that would make this
far too simple
for this is life
we live it or at the very least
we attempt to live it
how we do so is completely
up to ussome of us deign to argue the law
our bravest want to help the world
the generous become teachers
the brightest take us to the stars
and so i'm left
with a simple question
who am i in this
wonderfully bleak universe?
the answer in my mind
is just as simple as the question
i am a writer
i Ãžll minds with dreams
and bring hope to those lost
i exist to exist
and that is all i need
