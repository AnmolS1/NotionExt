the world moves on

how often do we stop to wonder
when the world will forgive
and when the world will forget
this world has a cruel yet
quite helpful reset button
it doesn't matter
if you've messed up that
one corporate meeting that
would've promoted you
or that
one homework that
could've brought your grade up
or that
one afternoon workout that
should've given you abs
you see
it really is quite simple
all you have to do
is press that reset button
learn from your mistakes
try again
and get better
