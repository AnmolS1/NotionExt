i love you

powerful words aren't they?
they might seem simple
but humor me for a moment
if i may
Ôi'
usually upon this spoken pronoun
one refers to a piece of themselves
if one were to say Ôi need to pee'
they only mean that they must expulse
or one may say i'm gonna shower'
to mean they will clean their skin
but the Ôi' in Ôi love you' is not so simple
for this one refers to the entirety
one's mind and body
to love requires wholeness
and this Ôi' is everything
that one can be
Ôlove'
to love or to love
wherein a means becomes the end
and an end, the means
what else can we call it?
love, such a swaying emotion
like waves of the pacific,
or a blindfold at a cliff's edge
nothing quite compares
to the exhilaration
Ôyou'
there's not much more to say
just as with the Ôi'
this Ôyou' encompasses all that you are
what you are today
and what you may be tomorrow
it's all of you i'll love
no matter what
so you see,
this phrase is one
to treasure
one to hold onto
to say such a phrase can give hope
and raise one's joy
erase stress
and relieve pain
and now without too much thought
i must say the same,
`i love you`
