death's beginning

we so often consider our lives
to be the main point in the
movement of our souls
but the death of our bodies
is not the end of it all
it is merely
a stopping point on this
the rail line of existence
we exist all throughout time
and we deign to understand more
but fail to realize that
we tend to overcomplicate
the coincidence that is us
our stories are mere sentences
and lives but simple chapters
in a book on a train
headed into oblivion
