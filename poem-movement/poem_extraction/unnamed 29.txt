unnamed 29

When I'm sad
I shut myself down.
I have no motivation for anything.
I tell myself that nobody cares,
even though I know some do.
I think about all the negative things
I could possibly think of.
I in√üict on myself all the pain I can,
thinking I deserve it.
I'm not sure why I do that,
but that's just how I am.
