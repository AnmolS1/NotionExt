unnamed 40

i have forgotten what it was like
to smile a real smile
after faking laugh after laugh
and grin after grin
i no longer remember
the feelingwhen i drag
the corners of my lips
towards my ears
not because i have to
or because i should
but because i want to
the emptiness has taken control
there is nothing left
i am nothing
and i am no longer
living my own life
as i breathe each breath
i wondershould i make this my last?
