ßowers out the window

staring out that old window
of that blue-gray 2012 camaro
all i can think about is
you and me
and how we could've been
but i guess we'll just never be
im passing by a meadow now
ßowers blooming into their
springtime beauty
but all i see here is you
i just can't get you
out of my head
it hurts to remember it all
because right now
i don't need help with physics
or to Þnd a place to work
i don't need math homework
or someone to crack a joke
i just need my friend back
but that ship has sailed
and left me here
waiting for you
