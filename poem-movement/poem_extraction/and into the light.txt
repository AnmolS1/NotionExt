and into the lightthere's a new day

Ãžnally coming along
years of hate and now
i've found the love
i can see the stars
and dream my dreams
this is the new me
that i guarantee
there's a new voice
stuck in my head
egging me on saying
"you can do it
go ahead"this is who i've become
a new person
all the wiser
so i hope i don't disappoint
because all i really am
is me
just another writer
