the rain

why do we love the rain?
i don't think it comes from
the science of necessity
or anything like that
i think we love the rain
because it is simply that
rain
the beautiful hopethe hopeful beautythe lonely pitter patter
the clamorous rolls
of calmly dangerous thunder
i think we love the rain
for all that it is
and for all that it ever has been
