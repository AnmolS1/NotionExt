writing: a hell unexplored

  pieces
       blocks
        fragments
    ideas dreams
      worlds
    stars
somehow they come from places
       unknown
they reach us, they take shape
in the form of
dreams
     confusing
    unrelenting
3am bursts of
   lexical obfuscations
leaves falling
      from trees invisible
  into concepts, crunchy
where can they go except
    our prison?
our inevitable finality
     an invincible tomorrow
protected by a vulnerable
   yesterday
nicknamed 'paper'
      they muddle themselves
 in a farrago of ambiguities
   and it is our function
our purpose in this purgatory
 to act as the sieve
to put these
       these 'words'
in our order
    it never was easy
    it never will be
  but there is something
a reason for our
       OCDour obsession to fix them
 it is what our people call
    the purpose of all life
   the driving force behind
consciousness and all others
     the reason we still
   live today
why i continue onwards
pushing towards some
      dream
not even i understand
    you see
that reason
                  is love
