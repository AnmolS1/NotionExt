devoid

he would say, if he could do so
that he became numb
devoid of emotion
and emptied to his core
but he still feels
he still feels butterflies
when she texts him
and he still feels happy
when she does too
the tears have stopped flowing
replaced by sleepless nights
food tastes like cardboard
so he simply doesn't eat
and life became blurry
so?
