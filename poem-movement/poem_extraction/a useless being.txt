a useless being

the title really gives it away
i am nothing
if not useless
utterly hopeless
completely incompetent
and any other form
of the phrase
there are quite simply
far too many examples
for me to go through
in a single poem
but after so many failures
i don't see how
i could possibly ever hope
to succeed
