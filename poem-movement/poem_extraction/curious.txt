curious

not even a little bit
no i'm not curious
i don't wanna know
what's in the box
the box over there
just peering at me
from under the bed
quietly sitting there
in all it's boxiness
no i don't i wanna
i will not open it
it's not my problem
i don't care at all
not even a little bit
ok maybe one peek
