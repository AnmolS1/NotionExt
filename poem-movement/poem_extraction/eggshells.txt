eggshells

merely a facade
these laughter and grins
these words that spill
like water from a faucet
gracefully and smoothly
for up there
where dreams would lie
exists a vacuous vestibule
once occupied by a quite
Ãžlling sort of enamoredness
but this simple love
has woefully been left behind
and so all that remains to be
remarked upon up there
is how impatiently i await
your return
and your love
