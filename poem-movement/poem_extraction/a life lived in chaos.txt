a life lived in chaos

filled with change and chaos
the plan never fails to fail
as work piles by the busload
his room drowns more each day
paper strewn about, filled with
ideas abandoned long ago
odds and ends of projects
too old to even be remembered
where does he fit in here?
his mind is boundless and yet
he is bound by his self-hatred
his inability to move past
self-imagined limitations
where does he go from here?
