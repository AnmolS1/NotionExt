Loneliness

i would say that i could be happy,
when i am amongst friends, dying of
laughter at an absolutely great
joke someone just made at the table
but then the sun becomes the dark moon
and my carefree grin changes to a
sadness, etched onto my low grim face.
and i lay in bed, thinking about
all the things i'm too afraid to say
even with pencil and clean paper
it's these sad lonely nights when I see:
i may seem quiet, sad, outgoing,
shy, and rambunctious, and happy too
but really, I'm quite simply empty.
