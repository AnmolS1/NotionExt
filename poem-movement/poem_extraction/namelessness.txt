namelessness

i know a boy
who quite simply hates himself
he looks in the mirror with disgust
pinches the skin on his stomach
and all he sees are his flaws.
i know a boy
who smiles as he dies inside
he solves others' problems
when he can't solve his own
and he thinks, i can't do anything right.
i know a boy
who causes pain to relieve pain
he wears long, dark sleeves
so that nobody can see it
he shall feel it all, forevermore.
i know a boy
who spills his feelings onto paper
to make his life a little less miserable
and as he reads it out loud
tears roll down his cheeks
as his mind is racing, saying
"i know this boy, this boy is me"
