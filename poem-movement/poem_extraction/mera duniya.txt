mera duniya

through rose-colored glasses
is the only way i see it now
where all my problems went
i do not know
still the same holds for stress
the morning comes with ease now
there is no rush in a life
where i am with you
to wake at your side is to wake
in a bath of warm silk
on a cold morning
and though i want nothing more
than to stay the day
i know that tomorrow morning
will bring more of the same
