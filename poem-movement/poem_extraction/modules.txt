modules

our lives are not solely
the poorly executed parts
consisting of disorder and
inconsolable heartbreaks
our lives are made up of
the billions of pieces
each one is its own module
contributing to a compounded
complexity of composite
convolutions
creating you, a being on this
ÃŸoating rock simply hurtling
in a vast ever-expanding
universe
and still
we laugh
