a beautiful garden

i'm not sure what's wrong with me
i keep writing these poems
hoping you'll notice
constantly pouring my heart out
because it's all i can do
to not burst into tears
instead of talking to you myself
i quietly sit against the wall
at 3am writing line after line
sometimes i wonder
what we would even talk about
if we met once more
how i would reintroduce myself
which jokes i would casually slip in
what shows we would discuss
the endless list of complaints
and through it all i keep thinking
"go for it! say something!"
"but it's not right."
"who cares? i know i don't!"
an argument set to endlessly replay
in my mind
all the while i know that
even if i were to say something
and even if you were to say
the unprecedented "yes"
it would still be wrong
because no matter how much
i would ever try
i would never make you happy
because all i am
is a mere bug
that loves to just exist
in this beautiful garden
you
