time to go

how love comes about
and why it goes
what it really is
and when do i know
there was a time long ago
i would've said the answer's obvious
can't you see it so clearly there?
it comes from their compassion
from their love, it comes here
of course now i know
that cannot be true
it mustn't be true
love must come from the self
save a destruction of one's own will
