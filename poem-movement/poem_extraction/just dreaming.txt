just dreaming

it's only been a few days
since i poured my heart out to you
and we still talk together
and we still laugh together
but something feels off
almost as if
something's Ãžnally clicked
and we're starting to move
farther and farther apart
i don't like it
in fact i hate it
all i ever wanted
was for me to be yours
and for you to be mine
but i guess
that's just not my destiny
or maybe it is
maybe after years of
not having spoken
we'll meet up somewhere
in some distant land
a small pub in London
a distinct acropolis in Greece
a sandy beach in California
a calm river in Venice or
maybe i'm
just dreaming
