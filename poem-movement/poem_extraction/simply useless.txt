simply useless

every time i try something new
every time i have a great idea
or even the slightest inkling of hope
that everything will soon be okay
that i will be happy at some point
it only ever takes a feather
placed on the delicate infrastructure
of my mind
to bring everything to the ground
always starting back at zero
always building back up
always working harder
and still
nothingever seems to work
i often wonder if it ever will
or if it never will
for what is the point
in working towards nothingness
if that's all i'll become in the end?
a pile of nothing6 feet underpeople move on
the world keeps turning
the universe keeps expanding
and nothing really changes
because all i am
is simply useless
