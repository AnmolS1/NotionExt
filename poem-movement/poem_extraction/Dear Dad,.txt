Dear Dad,

You've always been there for me
through thick and thin.
You teach me all I'll ever need to know
and still keep it interesting
with your clever jokes and quick wit.
Your love for us seems boundless
and though I know we keep testing it
we love you too.
So thank you for your hard work
your unconditional love
your immense knowledge
your hilarious wit
and all else you've given us.
Happy Father's Day!
Love,
your favorite son (Anmol)
