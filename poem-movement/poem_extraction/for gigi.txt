for gigi

i know it's more than difficult
for you to see and truly understand
just how beautiful you are
because you look at yourself
and all you can see
is the flaws
the tiny
most minute
imperfections
but here, what you don't realize
is how your own beautiful self
is so amazingso awesome
so amazingly awesome
that it's quite impossible
for me to verbalize your beauty
but here i am trying
your smile brightens a whole room
the room next door
people in Manhattan are complaining
of a bright light outside their window
that's you
you ask me if i'm mad at you
you ask me if i hate you
the answer is no
i could never be mad at you
i could never hate you
you are perfection personified
an impossibility brought here
some miracle of inevitability
the best part of my day
how indeed you lose yourself
in this sea of self-hate
shall never make sense to me
i don't see how someone so
smart
beautiful
funny
perfect
could not
love themself
well, even if you don't
i do
