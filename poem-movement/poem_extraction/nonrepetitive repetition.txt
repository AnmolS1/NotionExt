nonrepetitive repetition

i don't know what you want
and you just won't tell me
so here we are once more
stuck in this cycle of
impossible retreat
and yet we seem turned
in that i am wiser now
in that i understand now
so you confuse me when
you recoil and smile
you caress and smile
you insult and smile
you lean in and smile
so here i remain
unsure
