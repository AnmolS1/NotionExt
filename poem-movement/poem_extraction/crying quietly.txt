crying quietly

there are a lot of things i don't know
but i do know that i have missed you
i have missed you more than you know
hell, i've missed you more than i know
i thoughti was Þnished, over you
i could Þnally move on
but i didn't know
until i saw you again
for the Þrst time in months
how hard it is for me to live without you
how impossible it is for me to breathe
how ungodly my world has become
without your smile
without your laughter
without you
but still a part of me wonders
if this will end the same way
with me
holding that knife
in the corner of my room
crying quietly
