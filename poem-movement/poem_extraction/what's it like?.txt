what's it like?

i wonder what it must be like
to wake up and love yourself
to look in the mirror and not want to cry
to weigh yourself, see the number, and not want to puke
to be with friends and not feel ugly
to go into public and not be insecure
to go shopping for clothes and not feel fat
i just wonder;
what it's like to love your life
