alone

i feel it again
that same distinct feeling
i knew it once
all those years ago
and i suppose
i'd hoped i wouldn't
or couldn't
feel it ever again
but here it is
i don't know what's wrong with me
there are people all around me
and yet i can't seem to speak
my tongue catches between teeth
and words come out in disarray
my only thought repeats itself
"you weren't good enough"
"you weren't good enough"
"you weren't good enough"
and i realize
i'll never be good enough
not for her
and not for anyone else
perhaps i should remain nameless
another body under a bridge
another corpse lost in the ocean
another idiot with a hole in his head
another dead
alone
