softly

i could spend an eternity here
sitting on this old worn bench
surely you feel it too
at the edge of this small lake
you must feel this too
in the middle of this tall forest
hoping you feel this too
and you do
your head sinks onto my shoulder
my arm curls around you
wordless, you look up at me
i look back
well now i know
i could spend an eternity
gazing into your eyes
