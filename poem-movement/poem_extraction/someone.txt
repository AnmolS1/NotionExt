someone

someone is out there right now
in love with you
despite how you think of yourself
a boring
and stupid
and smelly person.
they love you,
they saw you last week
and wiped their sweaty hands
on the insides of their pockets
and they thought
about all the cute dates
and all the hilarious jokes
and all the amazing times
they would have
with you
