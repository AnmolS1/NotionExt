house of cards

these cards
quiet and peaceful
calm and thoughtful
kind and hopeful
they compile our lives
building up dreams
grand ideas and hopes
everyone has their own
set of these cards
we all make our own houses
but sometimes they fall
crashing down
crushing other cards
destroying any hopes
of achieving the dreams
once so greatly desired
but we can rebuild
we can iron out the creases
we can Ãžx our mistakes
we can bring back our dreams
it just takes time
patience
and hope
