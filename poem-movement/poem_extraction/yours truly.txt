yours truly

you understand nothing
not really
not the taylor equations up on the board
nor the history of your own planet
nor the inner workings of atp and electron spin
there is nothing you could ever understand
and there is nothing you can do about it
because at the core of every idea
at the core of every single thought
from concepts of galaxies to quarks
a question exists, unanswered
why?
why will we all rot into obscurity?
why does life hurt so much?
why must we suffer through hell?
why must we break?
and why do we survive afterwards?
i know not the answers to these questions
i merely propose them as a ponderance
for i have wasted away many years
considering the possibilities
millions upon millions of ideas
perhaps god truly doesn't care
but for all one knows, he may
it may be that we are not alone
but as it may be, we could be
you see, i am done.
i have spent my time thinking
now it is my turn to pass these questions on
to you.
please consider them wisely.
yours truly,
