the backside of nothing

i wasn't sure what i expected
it felt like nothing ever before
i stayed while you left
closing the back door
your inability to write back
doesn't surprise me anymore
after all, the simple truth is
it was me you never cared for
but perhaps this is it
my awakening to reality
you deserve so much more
than me, just a nobody
we were never meant to be
i understand that now
so maybe it's naive of me to
hope we'll meet again, somehow
