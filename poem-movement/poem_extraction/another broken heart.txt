another broken heart

how can i possibly begin to describe
the sad heartbreaking thoughts
and the bland sleepless nights
that i've had
because of you 
but i could never truly explain
just how long i'd wait
for you
because i know
even if you can't see it
that i'd wait forever
for our love
to Ãžnally
come to reality
because i'm simply
not willing to accept
that this isn't real
that what we have
isn't real
