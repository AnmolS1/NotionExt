at first glance

every night now
i remember those blurry ft calls
when we looked at each other
through rose-colored lenses
with smiles wide as could be
i still smile
just remembering
but now the roses are gone
and your giggle remains
laughing at my terrible jokes
what i wouldn't give
to hear your laugh again
