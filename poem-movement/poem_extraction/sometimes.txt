sometimes

sometimes
love'll push until you burst
and you must simply
come to terms
with the fact that
they'll never love you
the way you love them
you are nothing but a bug
an ugly little bug
in their beautiful garden
and after all they've put in
an inconceivable amount
of time and effort
into cultivating their garden
you're quite lucky to be there
but in the midst of
all these roses
the only thing
you can focus on
is the gardener
