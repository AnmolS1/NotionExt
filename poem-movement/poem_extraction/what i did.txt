what i didi wish there were a way to know

what i did that was so wrong
that the universe would decide
to hurt me in such a way
such a deceitful way
as blessing me with you
knowing you'd have to leave
only after allowing me
to Ãžrst mend these
shattered and scattered pieces
of an old, tired heart
and soon thereafter
breaking it again
truthfully i wouldn't wish this
on my worst enemy
for the pain is unbearable
and all i want nowis sleep
