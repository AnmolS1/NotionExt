function.add(my_life, you)

i had no ideawhat i would make for you
on your day
so i just started drawing
and as it began to take shape
i recognized it
for it was quite simply
a heart
with twirls here
and swirls there
it seemed quite chaotic too
holes everywhere
and a certain longing
for something unknown
but the basic idea remained
just the same
it was how my heart felt
every single time
i saw you
