ready

i'm not ready to lose you too
i don't think i'd survive
i promised you
i'd never fall in love with you
i promised you
i'd always be there for you
i promised you
i'd always be your friend
but it's far too late now
i have passed love
and passed soulmates
and left this plane behind
the jump itself
wasn't quite so scary
it's not the end either
it's the falling
not knowing when
or how
or who
but now i know who
and i know how
all that's left
is when
