an ode to goodbyes

they all say that goodbyes
are never forever
for we all Þnd each other
once again at some point
but that's not true
goodbyes are painful
for a reason
because they are Þnal
and Þnality scares us
we don't know how to just
deal with itand who knows
maybe i'll never get to
see you again
but you were here with me
and that's enough for me
i'll love you for forever
even if i never see you again
so for now
goodbye
