5 more minutes

i think i miss you more than anything in the world
i know i shouldn't
i know i need to get over you
i know this isn't good for me
but i also know that i still love you
and i know this doesn't matter to you
but i don't blame you for what happened
after all; all you did was love me
how could i be mad at you for that?
instead of cursing you, i thank you
for the wonderful months we had,
all the smiles,
the laughs,
the hugs,
the kisses,
but most of all
the love
i don't think i shall ever meet someone
quite like you
this letter of despair will never reach you
for i am far too ashamed to admit
that i still love you just the same
as i did all those months ago
i know your love for me is no longer
and this reality is far worse than i'd hoped
i now compare everyone to you
and nobody comes within
a fucking galaxy's distance
i think i'm just waiting now
for some miracle
of the tensors of our universe
to make sense of this jumbled nonsense
in a hopeful lunatic's brain, me
i hope i've grown since we last spoke
since that final hug on that fateful day
since my final brief moment of sanity
all i wanted was for that hug
to last forever
just like we would have
i don't think i shall ever meet someone
quite like you
i think i'm in love with you
sorry
i think i'll always be in love with you
sorry
