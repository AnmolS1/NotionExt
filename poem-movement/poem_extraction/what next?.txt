what next?

do any of you
just get this
overwhelming urge
to sit in a corner
and cry
because you know
that unlike
everyone else
unlike that eerily quiet boy
in the back of your math class
unlike that really smart girl
at the front of your spanish class
unlike that nerdy band kid
who's obviously in band
unlike all the others
you aren't going anywhere
