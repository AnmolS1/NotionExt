unnamed 119

there are times
i wish you would remember me
and just text me once more
in the hopes of rekindling
the friendship we once shared
but it's too late now
as always I've messed up
and our friendship turned to dust
and you left me behind
so there are also times
i wish i could forget
your incredible smile
and your sexy wit
your indescribable laugh
and your bright mind
that never ceased to make me smile
and so
all i ask of you
is that you remember me
just once
