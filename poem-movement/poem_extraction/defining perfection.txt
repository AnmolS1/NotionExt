deÞning perfection

your words leave my mind
confused and unreal
as they enter my soul
to be forever ingrained
in the walls of my heart
i once told myself
that i was Þnally over you
never again would i
worry about you or
let you take precedence
over my sanity
and i can't quite describe
just how amazing you are
or this poem would become
a novel of its own
but i can say as i have before
your quietly shy smile puts
a spark in my heart
your bubbly laugh brings
a peace to my ears and
your deep brown eyes send
a shiver through my soul
you see it's not very difÞcult
to continue onwards forever
but there quite simply aren't
enough adjectives to
describe how i feel
every time i see them
those deep brown eyes
