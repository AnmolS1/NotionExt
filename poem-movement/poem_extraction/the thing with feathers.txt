the thing with feathers

i switch between windows
sitting at my desk
watching pointless videos
reading pointless words
pointlessly hoping
i might open my phone
to that impossibility
"i miss you"
the one time a dark night
overcame my tired eyes
it was only you that entered
this sleep-deprived mind
beautiful and happy as ever
and i, so starved of hope,
let you stay
from the moment i arose
a pact was made, to simply
never allow the night
to anchor down my eyes
no matter how stormy the sea
no matter how hopeful the sun
