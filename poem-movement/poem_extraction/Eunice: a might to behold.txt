Eunice: a might to behold

the oceans quiver
as they watch
the storm in her heart
how it crackles and pops
and how she still lives
she still breathes
and she still thrives with
bravery, beauty, brilliance
she simply is herself
Ãžerce in every way
and somehow she showed me
a simple guy with
no will to continue
what it was like
to have hope again
