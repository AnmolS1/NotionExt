unnamed 55

and i simply can't do it
i can't just get over you
that's all i need to do or at least
that's what everyone says to do
sometimes i think
i'm Ãžnally over you
but then i see your face
and your contagious smile
and i hear your laugh
a sound i'll never forget
and when you think hard
and furrow your eyebrows
and the other hundreds of things you do
it feels like there's just
nobody else
who's as right for me
as you are
