the lamppost

there's a lamppost
outside my window
i quite often sit and stare
at that lamppost
when i'm having trouble
with my will to live
it may seem crazy
but it feels like
the lamppost understands me
it knows my deepest
and darkest thoughts
better than anyone else
and it always knows
exactly what to say
exactly how bright to shine
or how dim to glow
to help me feel better
but still
it remains as what it is
a lamppost
