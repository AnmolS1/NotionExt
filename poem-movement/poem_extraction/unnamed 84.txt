unnamed 84

i saw a cloud today.
it looked odd,
completely content,
if clouds could look so,
with it's own existence.
and i realized,
if something so
unimportant
yet omnipresent
could seem content,
then why can't i?
despite
my unimportance
and uselessness
my stupidity
and hopelessness
why can't i just
be happy?
i guess what i'm saying is
don't worry about the future
because no matter what
you'll be happy in the end
