love's venn diagram

love has been compared to a great many things
over a great many centuries
a bird in ßight
a tree in a meadow
a rose with no thorns
a cloud in an otherwise clear sky
a ßame that shall never die
a loaded gun that shoots to kill
a battle with no enda losing game
a canvas
a madness
a sickness
and yet
the deÞnition has escaped humanity
for longer than humanity has known love
