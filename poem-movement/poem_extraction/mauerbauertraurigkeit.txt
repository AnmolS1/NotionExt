mauerbauertraurigkeit

people are odd
they come to you for their needs
and leave you at the expense
of your own needs
even the good ones
the ones who
want to see you succeed
the ones who believe you will
even they leave you after a while
it was so much easier
to exist without people
to be who i wanted to beto feel the worth i tried to Ãžnd
in everyone except myself
