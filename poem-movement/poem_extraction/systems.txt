systems

there's an underlying order
in the midst of our chaos
but this order is
quite chaotic in its own right
and we'd like to believe
there's a mind
from before the beginning
pulling the strings
giving us hope and light
but really
we just can't accept that
perhaps
we don't have anyone
except ourselves
