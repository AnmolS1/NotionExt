faking reality

a simple problem
with a simple answer
he knew it too
but he didn't want to admit it
he didn't want to say
he'd gone down the same
exact
rabbit hole
as last time
and now?he fakes that smile every day
hoping nobody notices
praying that one day
he'll have the guts
to make that smile real
