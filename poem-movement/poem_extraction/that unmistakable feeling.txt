that unmistakable feeling

it's been so long, i thought it was all over
never really expecting to hear from you again
i stopped wondering what could have been
i moved on.
i was happy.
i could Ãžnally focus on myself and hope
hope that everything might still
turn out okay and
that all the things i left behind might still
be there for me and
that maybe i would never see you again.
i realize how terrible that sounds but
you didn't even have to try to
take my breath away and my focus along with it
you never meant to
make me wonder if i would ever be good enough
you never tried to
hurt me in any way
but you did.
you did.
and now? after months of nothing i see you again
wearing your illuminating smile
laughing your telltale laugh
and as i look into your sweet amber eyes
i feel it once again
that unmistakable feeling
