a little more time

we used to talk about everything
from the sun, moon, and stars
to what we'd have for breakfast
that table of ours was my serenity
and then it was gone
all within a 28 second call
you took with you my joy
my sleep
my love
my life
i still think about you
every damn day
praying for another 5 minutes
after all, you were my best friend
and that's all i want back
you can keep my love
and you can keep my life
i just want you back
