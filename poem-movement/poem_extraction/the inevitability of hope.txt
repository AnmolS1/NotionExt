the inevitability of hope

living is quite ambiguous
there must always be hope
to stay alive or else it all
comes crumbling down
so if you're still here
there's still hope
hold onto itand theneven after we are all gone
at least
in the material sense
we can keep moving forward
for that is the guiding force
in this quietness and this
chaos and impossibility
it pushes us forth
into the deep dark
into the unknown
into that empty void
that we Ãžll
with hope
