what's next

finally, the last words flow onto the page
like a dying spurt from a faucet
decades past it's prime
with tired arms
i close the laptop
and gather my things
legs like jelly
barely haul me to the library's exit
where the sun slaps my face
as i realize
another night has passed
so i smile
and my jello legs move again
off to the coffee stand
