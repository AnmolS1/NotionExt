the stars

it was an average wednesday
he was taking out the trash
a tiring, weekly task
but this time
on his way inside
he decided to do something
something he'd never
done before
he looked up
what he saw was
indescribable
the sky glimmered
with stars
stars that were
in every corner
filling up the dark
despicable unhappiness
with their own tiny spots of light
and he remembered
a small child
barely old enough
to reach the kitchen counter
sitting outside
counting the stars
dreaming of flying
amongst them
happy as could be
and he wondered
what happened to that child?
so full of hope
so full of dreams
so happy
and he realized
all that had happened
was that he had forgotten
the stars
