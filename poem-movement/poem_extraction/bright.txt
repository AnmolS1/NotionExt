bright

with an odd sense of fright
i jump awake and look around
at a bed i don't recognize
i push the silky white sheets aside
and realize that She is there
right next to me, asleep in quiet peace
i look around, trying to remain calm
횧nding that, i'm already calm
for this feels completely normal
i see a cat's bed in the corner
and notice Ned, embroidered on it
and what must be him, curled up in the middle
i get up and walk down the hall outside
curious to see who's life i am living
on the walls are book posters...
my book posters.
posters of books i've only ever had
mere notions and hopes and ideas for
it took everything i had to keep going
and move on down to the kitchen
next to a gorgeous living room
횧lled with trinkets and family pictures
smelling exactly how i knew it should
when i look into the kitchen there's
already someone there
it's Her, drinking her morning coffee
giggling at Ned who's watching
as the morning traf횧c goes by
but, something's different
on Her 횧nger
a ring
one that i didn't see before
a beautiful ring
and i tear up
because i know who this is now
and i know where i am now
I am home
