how to say goodbye...

i really don't think i'll ever forget you
i will always miss you
like how the stars miss the sun
in the morning skies
i have a folder Þlled with nothing
except quotes
all the love quotes i could Þnd
every single one
no matter who said it
when it was said
or what the context was
but i've realized
there will never be a quote
good enoughto describe the way
i feel for you
because truly
i love you
and i've never really been
able to say it out loud
not even to myself
but here i am
saying it now
just before i have to say
Goodbye.
