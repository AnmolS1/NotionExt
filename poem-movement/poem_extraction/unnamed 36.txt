unnamed 36

it was another normal day
everything was Þne.
but suddenly,
something snapped.
im not sure what
but something.
logic ßew from my mind
faster than a Þghter jet,
reasoning hid in a corner
as if it were playing hide and seek,
my clarity of mind dissolved
into a puddle of never ending ripples.
everything simply disappeared
one by one
until all that was left
was sadness.
and it grew
it grew until there was
no space for anything else.
now here i am
sitting in a corner of my room,
typing these words,
hoping for relief.
but none comes.
all that seems to come
is the sadness.
and the tears.
