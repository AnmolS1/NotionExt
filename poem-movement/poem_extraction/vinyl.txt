vinyl

those days are like a broken record now
forever on repeat and never ending
i can't get them out of my head
i can't get you out of my head
whatever i did to deserve this
must have been truly horrific
because i would not wish this on
my worst enemy
but perhaps this only makes sense
i don't know what to do
how to fix this
why i'm still here
who i am anymore
