forgotten friendships

you say that you're there for me
you say that you always will be
you say that you'll never forget me
but i don't believe you anymore
because
after all the crap we went through
and all the times we got through it
you still don't know me
the friendship we once had
is but a memory now
something for us to look back on
in 10 years and wonder
at how stupid we both were
to think that this friendship
would ever remain true
