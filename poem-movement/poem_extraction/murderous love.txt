murderous love

"You speak so highly of her
Even after she hurt you
beyond a bad day.
You nearly died that summer.
Why do you do that?
You speak of her
as if she put the fucking
stars in the sky
when all she did
was break you into pieces."
"Well that's the thing
about love
isn't it?
You'll let them
get away with murder
even if it's your own."
