crumbling leaves

it'll only be for a few days i tell myself
as i watch your bus pull away from the curb
i can go a few days
without seeing your smiling face at lunch
without hearing your terrible jokes in class
without you
i walk back inside waiting for my ride now
and pop in earbuds, turning the volume up
closing my eyes, i lean back against the wall
and try to imagine
already it's all fading
your hazel eyes become blurry
your messy bird's nest hair becomes hazy
your perpetually unorganized bag melts
and all of you begins to leave my memory
but i know it's only just beginning
the rest of the day is a blur
mostly me trying to not fall asleep
because i know when i do
the nightmares won't spare me this time
but then 3am comes along
and my comfy covers beckon to tired eyes
so i Þnally give in, getting in the covers
and with a sense of reprieve, i fall asleep
but i was right
the nightmares weren't going to spare me
images of your bus turned over
in ßames after an explosion
and you lying there torn limb from limb
suddenly there's a ringing and i jolt awake
it's the alarm
still ever-so-tired, i rise quietly
and dress for the day
the rest of which could not have gone by
any slower at all
lunch went back to a boring 30 minutes
and i ended up studying during study hall
which i suppose is the point
days now pass with the relentless speed
of a snail, stopping every few minutes
because it is asthmatic
all i can do is wait for you to come back
to just let me know that everything
will soon be alright
