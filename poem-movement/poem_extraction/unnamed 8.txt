another drop.
drip drop
drip drop.
the thick, red liquid
continues to fall
while I watch.
the blood-stained knife
still in my hand,
i reach for a
napkin to lay my hand on.
i enjoy this kind of pain.
the pain that is physical.
this pain is simple, obvious,
and oh so pure.
for a moment,
while i enjoy the pain,
i forget about everything else.
i forget all the impossible
questions, all the impossible
decisions, all the impossible
problems.
it all just seems so easy,
when you know the pain.
