cherry white trees

the trees here are doves
as the cold comes
they spread their wings and
take ßight to worlds unknown
we often ponderwhere these astounding
doves have gone to
for they do come back
when the ßowers bloom
and the birds sing
in the most beautiful white
innocent and dainty
loving and merciful
pure and true
