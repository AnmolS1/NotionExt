an apology

he misses the jokes he made
knowing they'd make her laugh
and he misses the fun they had
he misses late night calls
and the park bench
he's missed you
for 364 days now
and he'll hate himself forever
that what he did
took her smile away
he'll never forgive himself
for being the reason
she stopped laughing
