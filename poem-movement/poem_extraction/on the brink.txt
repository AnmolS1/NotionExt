on the brink

our lives are mere decks of cards
we like to keep them organized
and hope that they might simply
stay that way
but life doesn't like that
it shufßes itself and rearranges
its own cards into something
entirely unrecognizable
suddenly you have no idea
where you exist
what you're doing
why you're here
and everybody's moving
but where do you go
when all you can do
is move slowly towards the corner
quietly hoping
that life shufßes itself back
