remarkable

unfortunate isn't it?
that they only really found each other
in such a crisis
and so their firsts were flawed
a first kiss in a parking lot
and first "i love you"s
and first time waking up together
and first time falling asleep together
all through a screen
who's to say that their firsts
were even real to begin with?
he certainly would
what he felt was real
no matter how difficult it was
