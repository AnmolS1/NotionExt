an empty heart

to put it quite simply
i miss you
the conversations we used to have
the laughs we used to share
i miss hearing your voice
as you explained something
arbitrarily simple to me
i miss all of it
and i feel terrible
because i was jealous
when i found that someone else
had asked you to dance
and you
said yes
i hate the way all of it
makes me feel so empty
because i'm not supposed
to need you
but it feels like i do
