you are everything anyone needs

recently someone i hold near to my heart was told
that she is too fat and too short for her boyfriend
Þrst off, what the fuck
this is a PSA to all the motherfuckers
that would dare shame a person
calling them too short
too fator anything else
for someone they love
a relationship is not decided
based on whether two people
are similar enough
in both stature and shape
a relationship is decided
based on whether two people
are similar enough
in the love they give and take
in the way they make each other smile
in the way they stop each other's tears
in the way they push each other towards greatness
in all the ways that make a true relationship
so if you think for a fucking second
that you're not worth it
because you're not tall enough
or thin enough
or "sexy" enough
then please remember
it's your conÞdence
your smile
your intelligence
your love
that really makes you everything
anyone needs
