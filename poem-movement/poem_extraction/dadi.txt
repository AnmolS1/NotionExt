typing this title, tears begin to well
i don't know if you're out there
if you can read my words
if you can hear my thoughts
i can only hope you understand
the words i never got to say
i miss you
and i wish
for something
but even i don't know what
sometimes
i still hear your laughter
as i pass by the dinner table
and when i turn on my heels
expecting to see you
all i see are empty chairs
you left me with an empty chair
in the round table of life
of my life
i don't blame you
but i don't suppose
it'll ever be taken again
