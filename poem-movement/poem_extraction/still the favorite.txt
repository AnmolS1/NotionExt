still the favorite

pain
it seems far too simple a word
to properly describe this
what he feels is far worse than that
far more harsh than that
before this, he had the next
10 years
planned out
he knew exactly what would happen
and in what order they would
he was ready
to live the rest of his life
according to an idea
the incomprehensibly idiotic idea
that real love might exist
more than that
he still sees her everywhere
in the heart of his writing
in the background of his lock screen
in the cards in his drawer
she's everywhere
and to him
she was everything
