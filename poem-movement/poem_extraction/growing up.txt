growing up

sleepovers become raggers
juice becomes alcohol
candy becomes weed
butter knives become razor blades
scraped knees become slit wrists
death becomes a trend
love becomes real
2 + 2 becomes 2x(5+7)=5x/78
timeouts become detentions
training bras become push-ups
footy pajamas become lingerie
kisses become sex
bikes become cars
society becomes fucked
everything becomes impossible
trust becomes nonexistent
nice girls become sluts
we become something we said we never would
goodbyes become forever
cooties become broken hearts
now tell me again
why we wanted to grow up so fast?
