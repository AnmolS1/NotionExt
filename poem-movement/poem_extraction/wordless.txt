wordless

6 ideas typed out halfway
6 ideas backspaced into oblivion
the only words i can find
come with downcast eyes
and a blank stare
it's hard to admit one's own
fallibility
after all
one works hard to correct it
but there is no amount of work
that can correct a tired mind
one that has all but given up
