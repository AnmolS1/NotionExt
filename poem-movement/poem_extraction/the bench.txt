the bench

he doesn't need the pictures
her smile is still there
a gentle reminder that
everything will be ok
he doesn't need the texts
her voice is still there
warming his heart
with every syllable
it was never her gifts
that gave him what he needed
it was her
a place in her life
and a part of her joy
of her love
he'll never get that back
and he can't accept that
so here he sits
on the edge of a balcony
wishing she were here
so he could finally
put his arm around her
