the greys

somehow it happened again
he sat in the corner of his room
hiding
hiding from the sharp lie of help
but there's nowhere he can run
nowhere he can hide
it always finds him
no matter who he clings to
no matter how fast he runs
no matter how long he stays awake
it's been 5 days now
120 hours
7200 minutes
432000 seconds
and he's felt
every
single
one
but what can he do?
stand in the road?
jump from a skyscraper?
inject air into his veins?
fire a gun between his eyes?
or turn once more
one last time
to that beautifully sharp lie?
