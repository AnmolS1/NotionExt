i know it's over

they lay me back in the ground
shoveling soil on me
as i watch from far below
embracing the Ãžre that surrounds me
and i hear a laugh
a laugh that curdles milk
and makes me feel all of it
all of the hopelessness
all of the painall of the hatein this world
and i know
i know it's over
