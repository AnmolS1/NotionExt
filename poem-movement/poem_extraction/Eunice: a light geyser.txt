Eunice: a light geyser

they say that black holes
pull everything in
even light cannot escape
the gravity of such a
dense powerful thing
if that's true
you must be the opposite
for you continue to give
love, pure and true
loyalty, unrequested
and hope, far more important
than any simple commodity
you bring joy to all
and hate to noneyour mere entrance
Ãžlls the room with a certain
brightness
unknown to the people inside
i only wish i could give back
even a tiny portion
of the hopethat you've given me
