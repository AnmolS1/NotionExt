memories of a time long ago

walking home late at night from work
listening to some old songs
thinking about the tv shows
you forgot to record
thinking about the kids
already asleep in bed
thinking about the wife
more upset than ever
thinking about dinner
getting colder by the minute
you walk faster
eventually you get there
you open the door
there to greet you is
an empty chair in front of a small tv
bottles of beer strewn
like your clothes
are strewn across your room
and suddenly you remember
there's only one car
in the driveway now
not because you sold
the other one
but because it was in
far too many pieces
after the engine blew up
