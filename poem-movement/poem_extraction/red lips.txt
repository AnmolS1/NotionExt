red lips

words escape his racing mind
it's rare that he finds himself so
impossibly without words
but then again
she always was his impossibility
more than an impossibility
she had become
the star to his night
always there for him
bright and giggly
filled with jokes that never failed
to bring a smile to his face
so here he sits watching
as her eyebrows furrow
her jaw clenches
and her eyes
her deep sea green eyes
close
how he wishes he could help
but there's nothing
he can do
instead he simply smiles
for her beauty is
to him
impossibly unparalleled
he wants to tell her
tell her about his plans
his hopeful wishes
but all it takes is one look
and he loses himself
the hours slip away
and every time she laughs
his heart overflows with
butterflies, keeping him quiet
fluttering around
so instead he remains silent
waiting for the right moment
to finally let those butterflies
fly away
