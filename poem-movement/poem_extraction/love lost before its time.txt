love lost before its time

here we are once more
i loved you
again
and i thought you did too
but again
i was wrong
and again
it's far more than painful
it's absolutely bewildering
i know i can't continue on
loving you
so here i'll end
even though this love won't
i'll have to just do it
i'll have to end
this end
