paintingmy bathroom ÃŸoor

covered in red
my new knife
laying beside me
as i wait for my old friend
i stare up at the ceiling
wondering at how
even the smallest things
look so different when you know
it's the last time you'll see them
impatiently i pushed
and the red spread
and i laid back
and smiled as my old friend
took me away
for the last time
