a gut feeling

it was quite the refresher
to finally get to talk to you
once again after all this time
i never fully knew how much
i really missed you
talking to you
joking with you
and hearing your laugh
until that phone call

but then you mentioned him
without so much as
a passing glance
but i knew the truth
i knew how even one dance
could mean so much more
and it didn't seem to matter
to my heart
that my mind was simply
done with it all

maybe that's all just me
because here i am now
in a dark room
huddled in the covers
with headphones on
blasting my music
trying to not fall back in
back in that pit of despair
