not yet

the morning came today
once again
but the sun rose differently
for i thought that i had
Ãžnally moved on from you
until i was asked
in all seriousness
if i had one true wish
anything my heart desired
what would it be?and in all my stupidity
all my heartbroken mess
i knew immediately
i would waste that wish
on you
