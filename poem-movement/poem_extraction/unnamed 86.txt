we're all addicted to something
something that takes the pain away.
and letting go of that addiction
is usually one of the hardest things
we'll ever do in life.
sometimes,
the only reason
we can't let go
is because that one thing
was the only thing
that made us happy.
but it wasn't real
not really real
there are better things out there
better things for all of us
we just need to be patient
and hope that one dayit'll come to us
