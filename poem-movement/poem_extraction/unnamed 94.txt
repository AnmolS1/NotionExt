unnamed 94

i'll be good for a while
i'll talk more, laughs more
eat and sleep normally
but then something happens
like a switch that turns off somewhere
and all i'm left with
is the darkness of my mind
but each time it feels like i sink
deeper and deeper and deeper
and i'm a bit scared
terri√ûed that one day
i won't make it back up
i feel like i'm gasping for air
screaming for help
but everyone just looks at me
with confused faces
wondering what i'm struggling over
and it just makes me feel crazy
What the hell is wrong with me?
