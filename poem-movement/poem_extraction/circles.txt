circles

the trains continue
not minding their business
breaking dams built years ago
cracking life apart
piece by piece
these circles may be it
this destructive spiral
the final burst
far gone is the breaking point
any previous end seems
minuscule
compared to this
but they aren't
this is simply another end
and the trains will calm
and the dams will reform
and life will repair
