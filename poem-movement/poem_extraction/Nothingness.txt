Nothingness

my life has taken a sharp downward turn
i can't Þnd joy, my heart feels only grief.
no more pleasure from watching candles burn
or counting veins on the back of a leaf.
i spend hours of each day alone in bed
trying to keep the outside world at bay,
straining to conceal voices in my head
and wonder if i'll make it through today.
all the world around me has grown so dark
there is no beauty left to bring me joy.
black and grey surround me with lines so stark,
straight-edge razors are my favorite toy.
too afraid to live Ð too afraid to die
too afraid to breathe Ð i can only cry.
