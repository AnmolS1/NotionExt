unnamed 120

i know in my mind
that i should be happy
and that what i have is incredible
that i'm so lucky
to live in a house
and to have the world at my hands
but i can't help but think
am i worth all this?
am i worth the effort?
sometimes it feels like nobody else
really thinks so
there are times
i can see my future
and it only lasts a few more seconds
and there are other times
when i feel that i have no idea
what's in store for me
i wonder at the uselessness
and the effectiveness
the emotionless
and the impassion
the hopeand the utter defeat
that all circulate at once
and i am simply helpless
so i sit and stare
hoping for something to happen
knowing nothing will happen
