blues

what becomes of us?
what do we become of others?
what procures us from this place?
pushes us further into it?
shakes our lives apart?
glues it back together?
these questions
and others too
a mind races through thoughts
as a jet through clear skies
and yet
the mind, the soul, remains
torn like recycled homework
people, gone
food, tasteless
sleep, nonexistent
but still
the sky is blue
