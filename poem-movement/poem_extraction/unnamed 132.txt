unnamed 132

It feels odd,
Knowing that for once
You Ãžnally have a chance
At happiness.
Even though it could
All be taken away
At just a moment's notice,
You have a chance.
But you also
Know this.
If you mess up,
Even just a slight miss,
You will drop deeper
Into the personal Hell
That you created for yourself
Than you have ever
Been
Before.
So,
Don't mess up.
