the sun sets again

and so it closes once again
the day ends with no bang
no loud explosion
just a quiet sunset
and a happy smile on her face
he looks over at her again
when he thinks she can't see
there have been
thousands of sunsets in his life
there would be thousands more
but there would never be
another girl
quite like her
she looks back at him
he isn't the boy she'd dreamt of
he doesn't have perfect abs
nor does he have a chiseled jawline
he isn't the richest man on earth
he has a simple 9 to 5 job
but still she loves him
his jokes make her smile
sometimes
and he knows
how to make her happy
after a bad day
he understands
her quirks
he sees
her flaws
and loves them all
he loves her
and she loves him
quite the happy ending,
wouldn't you say so?
