a true friend

sometimes i wonder
if there's any good truly left
and just as i give up hope
you seem to magically appear
with the simplest of notiÞcations
"are you okay?"
and as i tell myself to say yes
that all is Þne
that all is okay
my hands type out
"not really"
and there you are
somehow always knowing
exactly what to say
so for that, thank you
thank you for being
a true friend
