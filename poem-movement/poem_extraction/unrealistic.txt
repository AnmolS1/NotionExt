unrealistic

she still doesn't believe
she's lost her conÞdence
she calls herself "Dumb Bitch"
she uses humor
to hide her insecurity
she believes
that she is ugly
and doesn't deserve
to be happybut she doesn't know
how beautiful she looks every day
walking into class with that smile
the one that makes everyone's heart
just melt right there
she doesn't know
how hilarious she is all the time
somehow managing to make me laugh
even in the saddest of my sad boy hours
she doesn't know
how incredible she is
so supportive, a Þercely loyal friend
she'll always be there for her friends
even when they don't want it
because that's who she is
an awesome person
and she deserves to be happy
she deserves all the good things
i just wish she could see that
in herself
