home

she doesn't know it yet
for her adorable obliviousness
blinds her
as he drives to his house
from the grocery store
she texts him
"are u home?"
and he responds "not yet"
she still doesn't understand
until he can make her breakfast
every morning
and he can come home to her
every afternoon
until they share a bed
every night
his answer will continue to be
"not yet"
