Darkness

108 feet high. The brisk air and silence
Are almost enough to make me turn around.
But I need to Þnish what I started,
First I take a peek out over the edge,
And the scene materializes in my mind.
My body is sprawled on the ground,
blood splattered in all directions.
People screaming as they realize
What has transpired in their midst.
They call 911, and they hold my head
As they tell me that everything
Will soon be okay, that help
Is on the way. I simply lay there,
In silence.
In pure silence.
In Þnal silence.
So, I begin. I hold one foot out
Over the edge, and with my last
Goodbye, I jump. The 108 feet
Pass by in the blink of an eye.
And as I lay there, I realize
That nobody has come.
Nobody wants to help
this nobody.
So I lay there.
In silence.
In pure silence.
In Þnal silence.
