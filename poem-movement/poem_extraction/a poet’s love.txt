a poet's love

he'd always hoped
that he'd find a love
like in those wonderful cartoons
where music plays from nowhere
hearts replace their eyes
they float towards each other
and everyone
always
ends up happy
after so long
he had begun to think
perhaps this type of love
only exists in stories
in poetryin the falsities of our world
but maybe
she would be truth
he needed
