let go

his thumb lingers over the delete button
once again he thinks it over
why is he doing this?
to move on?
would this really help?
his eyes can't move from the prompt
"Delete 648 pictures?"
it's certainly the right thing to do
but no
in a rather stupid moment
of frustration
he throws the phone
not anywhere really
just away from him
and he puts his head down
to try once more
and fall asleep
