living a lie

the rope stares me down
daring me to do it
daring me to get it over with
daring me to Ãžnish the job
and i look around and think
who could stop me?
if i were to leave
just go away right now
who would care?
who would give a second thought
to the idiocy that is me
to the uselessness that i exist as
to the nothingness that i am
so i pick up the rope
tie the noose
and the rest is but history
