phenomena

wherein we as events may be immeasurable
we can only determine the extent to which
we do not exist
through our own consciousness
in and of itself
a phenomenon
consider this:
that we live
and do so without force
that we love
and do so without force
that we die
and do so without force
we are far more than phenomena
more than people
we are souls
we exist through naught but spite
we hold our breathe in the presence
of ourselves
and hope for the justification
of our phenomena
