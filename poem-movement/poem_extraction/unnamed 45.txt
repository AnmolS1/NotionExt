unnamed 45

Wanting to die
is a strange sort
of feeling.Planning your death,
and timing it
just right.
Writing notes to people
to make sure
they don't feel bad.
Doing schoolwork
because nobody cares
if you want to die,
you still have work.
Waiting for the day
to come
and making sure
everything is perfect.
Knowing that soon
everyone and everything
you've ever known
will drop away
into quiet,simple
nothing.But you won't care,
you won't care
about any of it.
Because it'll Þnally
be over,
and you will Þnally
be at peace.
