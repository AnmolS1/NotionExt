stone cold (don't post)

i'll never forget that day
you put it in my hand
and with both hands
curled my fingers over it
you smiled at me
the most genuine smile
i think that was when i knew
i loved you
and i knew that you did too
it still sits there
in my desk
quietly waiting for me
i turn it over sometimes, hoping
hoping it brings back
some memories long forgotten
something to remind me of why
why i loved you the way i did
why i still love you the way i do
all i feel is cold now
i wonder if you feel the same way
does he make you feel better than i did?
maybe i should've loved you more
made you feel more loved
maybe if i'd loved you more
you wouldn't have left me
i'm still waiting
im waiting for you to come back to me
even though i know you never will
every time i get a text
there's a small part of me
hoping it's from you
even though i know
you've forgotten me
i'll never forget you
