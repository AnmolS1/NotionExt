bottomless thoughts

how people avoid these thoughts
these endless spiraling thoughts
is beyond my understanding
for once a simple idea takes hold
at least in my simplistic mind
it begins to create its own web
spiraling outward
farther and farther until Ãžnally
the web hits a wall
and it all comes crashing down
but not even this quiet sleep
can push the thoughts away
they are roaches
always coming back for more
and this time
i'm not sure
that i can push them away
