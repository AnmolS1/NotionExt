unnamed 105

a discovery of life
and deathboth deadly in their own
deadly ways
some of us like to try
Ãžnding life in death
and death in lifebecause it makes us feel
as though we know
something important
or that we know
more than we should but
really none of it exists because
sometimes that which we see
isn't
and that which we don't see
isand so there's no point
in trying because
all of us are just tiny specks
on a tiny speck
in a tiny speck
in another tiny speck
in a vast dark place
