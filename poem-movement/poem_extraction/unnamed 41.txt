unnamed 41

It's far too late at night once again
But I simply can't help myself
I simply can't sleep.
It's become abundantly clear lately that
It is not possible
To undo what is not undoable
To Þx what is unÞxable
To achieve what is unachievable.
And yet,
Here I am
Making plans,
Planning conversations,
Helping more,
Joking more,
All in the singular hope
That she might notice.
But, it's all for naught
As I remember who I am,
What I amNothing.
