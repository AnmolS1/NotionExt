years forgone

the average human lives
approximately 79 years
and so about 28,835 days
how many days do we waste
in desperation for nothingness
a mere hopefulness
in pursuit of an elusive
endlessness
we must remember
those days from long ago
when life was not a success
or a failure to be achieved
but when life wassomething to be felt
and explored
to far more than its fullest
