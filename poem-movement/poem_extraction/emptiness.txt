emptiness

why does everybody talk
about that side of depression?
the simple minutes leading up
to the endwhen the decision to go
is done
why does nobody talk
about that side of depression?
the days when
you can't move
you can't breathe
you can't sleep
you can't eat
you can't do anything
except think
about the endand pray
for the end
and hopewhen the end comes
it'll be quick.
