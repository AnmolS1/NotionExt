the instrument

it's 2am again
and i can't sleep
so i'll sit down at my desk
set my playlist to shuf√üe
and let it breathe
my instrument is a quiet one
you don't need much skill
or dexterity to play it
all you really need
is a soul
and a mind to go with it
some people like to try
to make their music so very
intricate
and layered
and complex
but i think sometimes
just the simplicity of it all
can make something so odd
quite beautiful
