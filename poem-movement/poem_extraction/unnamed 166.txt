unnamed 166

i'm so exhausted
i feel like i keep living
the same day
over and over again
the same boring routine
the same meaningless drama
the same emotionless feelings
i'm just sick of it
i want to feel alive
and happy for it
but i'm constantly dying
and everything just feels
so pointless
i just want it to end
