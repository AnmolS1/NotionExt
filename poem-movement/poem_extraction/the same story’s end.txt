the same story's end

what else is he to do
but wonder at what comes next
perhaps they begin again
he hopes
and perhaps the story ends differently
he considers
could they?
he wonders
there was a time
he remembers
when the plan was different
he smiles
and all was good
he tears
having that plan again would be nice
he hopes
