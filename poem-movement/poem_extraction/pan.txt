pan

first, the light dims
then, the focus blurs
somehow hyper intense
and broader than all,
a single particle
seems bigger than a galaxy
and yet a galaxy
feels incomparable
to tattered leaves
crunched,
it feels
crunched,
and the mind
melted,
thoughts faster
than earnhardt,
heartbeat slower
than evolution,
eyes forget to hear pain,
instead they hear the
wild
scared
abused
person
left behind,
broken again.
