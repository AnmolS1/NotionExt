unnamed 83

i don't understand
why nobody understands
the unimportance
of themselves
and the meaninglessness
of their lives
why are we here?
what is the point?
nobody knows the real answer
we all hide behindsilly sayings
and putrid poetry
and ambiguous adages
when really
we're just scared
scared of not knowing
scared of never knowing
scared of being scared
there's no point
no point in having faith in love
believing in a God
that may or may not exist
or having hope
that intangible, useless thing
i guess what im saying is
don't worry about the future
because you don't matter
you won't matter
and nobody really cares about you
