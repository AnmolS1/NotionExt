period

there are no characters in this story
no reason to keep any secrets
no lies to be told
it is simply our thoughts
that keep us from our own
and we must recognize these lives
as nothing but lives
for what is the point
without an end?
you see, a period is far more
than a simple end to a story
it is a mere caesura
a pause between this story
and the next
