an ode to markers

your usefulness is unappreciated
your sacrifice, undermined
giving a part of yourself
each time you are used
with no regard for the toll
it takes on you
on behalf of all professors
teaching distracted students
and students
cramming for final exams
and children
drawing fantastical scenery
thank you
