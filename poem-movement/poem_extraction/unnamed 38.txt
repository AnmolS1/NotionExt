unnamed 38

"Are you happy?" is such a difÞcult question. I always say yes, because I have friends, I 
laugh at jokes, I go out a lot and have fun. My life isn't as bad as it could be, and I don't 
have terrible problems. It could be worse. But then, one night at 3am, when I'm alone 
still awake, lying in bed, thinking about life. I Þnd myself crying my heart out suddenly 
convinced that nobody likes me, and nobody will ever like me. I feel horrible and I 
question everything I had and I don't really know if I was ever happy at all.
