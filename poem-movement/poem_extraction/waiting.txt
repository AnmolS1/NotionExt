waitingi'm still waiting for her.

after all these years,
all the times i wanted
to just give up,
i'm still waiting.
and i know it's stupid
i know it's idiotic
to believe that something
that amazing would happen
anywhere
outside of a fairytale
but still,
as much as my brain knows
that she will never do it
my heart
still leaves my phone
at full volume every night
