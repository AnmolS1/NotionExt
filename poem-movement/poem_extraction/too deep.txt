too deepi keep thinking about Ãžnally

talking to you again
waiting for that text
for your name to pop up again
but i keep forgetting
that the way i fell for you
was something that i can't
come back from
i'll always be there for you
when you need me
that much won't change
but i don't know anymore
how to talk to you normally
without falling for you
all over again
every single time
