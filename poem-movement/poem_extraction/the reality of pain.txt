the reality of pain

i wish i could tell you
what you mean to me
but if i tried
you'd be here reading this for weeks
so here's the condensed version
you mean more to me
than paneer 65
     cookies
     water     my bed
     the restroom
     my computer
     my phone
     wi√û     electricity
you could name anything
and i'd save you
before even thinking about the other
and i wish you could see that
but you can't even look me
in the eye anymore
and it hurts
it hurts like hell
it hurts so bad
i've gone back
to pretending reality isn't real
and the pain on my wrists
is all that i feel anymore
