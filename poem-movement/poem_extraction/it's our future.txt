it's our future

i've been wondering lately
if it is still in my best interest
to continue talking to you
to continue being your friend
i spent so much time
working out different outcomes
of different decisions
and when i realized that
i couldn't predict the future
i knew i had to look
to the past
so i remembered
all the late nightsand all of the hateful words
all the kind smiles
and all of the do not disturbs
but most of all
i remembered a dance
it was but one dance
to a cheesy clich‚Äùd song
but for those 4 minutes
and 43 seconds
i was in a place that those
who believe in it
call heaven
and now here i am again
declaring that i'm not giving up
not now and not ever again
because the simple truth is
i love you
so here's to us
and a Perfect existence
