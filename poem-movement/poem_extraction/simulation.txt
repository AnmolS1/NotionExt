simulation

the question has been asked before, but i'd like to restate it. are we living in a 
simulation? what if we are? what if we are in a simulation wherein each atom has been 
coded? where each element is a constructor waiting to be called upon to form new 
compounds? would that explain the law of conservation of mass? what about the laws 
of thermodynamics, could those be explained by computer programming constraints? 
but then, you say, we have free will. how can you explain humans having free will if all 
our soul is, is a compilation of switch and if statements? if all we are is a jumble of 
predetermined phrases and thoughts, how would we know that that free will even 
exists? how do you know that you are not programmed with the thought that you have 
free will? well what about god, you may ask. what about all the religions and dialects 
and randomness in the world. well, i would respond, what about the big bang? that oh-
so-amazing explosion of code when a programmer begins a new project. the logic, the 
structure, the predictability. the methodology of creating a random universe. you see, it 
all makes sense. ah, you may say, what about the things that don't make sense? what 
about the death, the evil, the cruelty, the wars, the disease? as for that, i remind you, 
good always seems to win out over evil. i wonder, does string theory describe the 
existence of other universes, or the connections between different programs, and 
therefore different simulations? could just there be other simulations out there like us, 
trying to understand what's happening around them? and if we are in a simulation, i feel 
the question has to be asked. what if one day, our computer is turned off?
