the moon
it seems like such a
stereotypical topic
to write about
and yet
it really is a beautiful thing
a small ball of rock
and space dust
re√üecting light
from a different rock
that's just a lot hotter
the moon is so simple
yet so complex
in it's mesmerizing beauty
and unparalleled hope
it brings to all
