imagine nothing
no, not darkness,
a darkness is
still something
i mean real nothing.
what do you see?
i'll tell you what i see
i see peace
	and i see chaos
i see love
	and i see hate
i see it all
because that's what nothing is
it's everything
and it's quite dif√ûcult
to imagine that
since there's quite simply nothing
that allows us to see nothingness
and the nothingness that exists
inside of everything
