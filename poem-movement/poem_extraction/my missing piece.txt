my missing piece

it's only been one week
one week since you left
and it's come to the point
where i'm no longer sure
what to do with myself
so i sit here typing away
hoping it'll restore air
to this de√üated heart
i'm not sure how i'll be
able to survive another
2 weeks without you
it'll be more than hell
i'm sure of that much
but still
here sits my heart
waiting for you to just
come back
always
