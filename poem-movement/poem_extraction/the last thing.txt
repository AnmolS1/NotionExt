the last thing

the window was surprisingly easy to open
and the brisk january winds were refreshing
against his bare feet
he knew this was wrong
in his dream, it ended differently
there was one last thing he needed to do
so with a speed dial
and a few seconds before voicemail
be prepared his speech
"hey it's me
just wanted to say goodbye
and remind you how much
i love you
i'll see you soon"
but then a voice sounded
"hey! what's up?"
*click*
he hung up
and that was it
the last thing
