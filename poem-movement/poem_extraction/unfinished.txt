unÞnished

there was once a work in progress
it was called "worth it all"
meant to be the last of the thoughts
my consciousness would have
propelled into existence
it took many moons to realize that
there was still quite too much left to do
too many bagel bites to eat
too many cats to pet
too many theories to prove
too many people to help
too many days to live
so perhaps i must continue onwards
into that deep dark below not
because i want to but rather because
i need toin fact we all need to
you are a story, vivid and beautiful
and come what may
your story deserves to Þnish
the right way
so here it is, my rebirth as me
and your rebirth as you
unÞnished and ready
