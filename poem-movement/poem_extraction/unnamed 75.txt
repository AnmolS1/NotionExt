it's very difÞcult usually
for this person to understand
just how beautiful she is
because she looks at herself
in the mirror
and only sees the ßaws
the imperfections
and nothing else
what she doesn't realize
is how her own beautiful self
is so amazing
and so awesome
and so amazingly awesome
that it is nearly impossible
for me to put it into words
and yet i try
her smile brightens a whole room
and the room next door
her pure unadulterated joy
contains nothing but hope
her humbleness is uncontested
and her laugh
her laugh
could bring peace to the entire world
could make a million babies smile
as they drift off to sleep
and her laugh brings me to a time,
a time when nothing is wrong
and everything is just right
because that's just how awesome she is
