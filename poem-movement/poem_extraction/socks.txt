socks

are not meant to be worn when asleep
one may wear socks
when wearing shoes
and not sandals
or slides
and not slippers
but never when asleep
because
why?
why would one do such a thing
such a horrendous, horrific thing
such a malicious, monstrous thing
such an atrocious, appalling thing?
it seems this world truly is
imperfect
for it is those
who sleep with socks on
that drive us closer
towards an unyielding end
each and every night
