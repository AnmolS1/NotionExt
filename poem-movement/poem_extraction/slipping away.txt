slipping away

with a tired sigh
and a beat of the drum
the world washes away
leaving behind the sun
all i wanted to dowas make my parents proud
but i guess all i could do
was let my parents down
im sixteen in my room
contemplating my life
i don't wanna dealwith all this fucking strife
my future is coming
ready, real, and fast
but all i can do
is sit and be harassed
by my own thoughts
and my own fucking people
i just want it to end
i just want to be peaceful
