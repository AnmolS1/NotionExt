mad?

how could i possibly
be mad at you
my very Ãžrst everything
and quite possibly my last
for all the reasons
you have to hate me
to despise me with all your soul
you still consider me your friend
and so i shall concede that
perhaps this logomachy
is quite pointless
in simple words
there are times
i feel as though my heart
may burst with all the
longing and excitement
i feel when i thinkof you
so no
i am not mad
