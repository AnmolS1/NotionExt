to raise a child

there was no leaving these people
i'd known some of them
for a decade
and there was simply
no leaving them
for i'd always know them
or at least
i'd like to believe so
because as they called out 150
and i walked to the car outside
on that last day
i looked back at this
giant red block of bricks
that i had grown up in
where i learned
how to say hello in spanish
and how to Ãžnd the area of a circle
and when to use its or it's
absolutely everything
and i knew that nothing
could ever replace that
the memories i made there
will last more than a lifetime
but we said our goodbyes
and that was that
the end of an era
our era
