remembrances

there it sits
near a corner of my desk
as smooth
and round
as the day you gave it to me
it means more now
than it ever did before
perhaps i'm looking for meaning
where there may be none
but still i wish you were here
so i could regale you
with stories of the hard times
that a simple rock got me through
