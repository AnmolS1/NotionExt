stupidly

it always starts as nothing doesn't it?
or it's supposed to
the hands graze past each other
or a sideways glance in a coffee shop
a small bump walking opposite ways
god how i wish this started small
but here i am
half naked in his hotel room
praying i find my pants
before i have to get to court
and argue opposing the same man
whose hotel room
i just spent the night in
