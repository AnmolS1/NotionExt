nightmares

they come to visit me in the dark
the happy days
the ones that i missed
i wish i could go back and Ãžx it
and keep those unknown days
from haunting me any longer
but i can't
so they keep coming
every single night
as the moon rises
so do the nightmares
forcing me awake
for days on end
they starve me of sleep
and have slowly managed
to destroy any dream i once had
of being happy
