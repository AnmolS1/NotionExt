unnamed 58

i know i need to get better,
but most of the time these days
i don't think i want to.
sometimes i try to do better.
i ponder the qualities
that others may see in me,
and even after hours,
upon hours,
upon hours
of thinking,
i still Ãžnd myself worthless.
i know now
it's not a question
of whetheri will end my own life,
rather,
it is when.
