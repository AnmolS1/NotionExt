Being suicidal doesn't mean that I'm going to kill myself. Being suicidal is having this 
inexplicable ache while you're living. It's waiting for your life to end, and wishing that you 
didn't have to carry on. Having this ache, and this incapability to feel happy living, 
doesn't mean that I am going to kill myself; it just means I wouldn't mind dying.
