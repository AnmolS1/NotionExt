the nondescript pain

it exists, that much is true
but it's almost as if the pain is
an enigma wrapped in some
invisible mystery
thrown to the edge of our
universe and
blown to bitsit is indecipherable, quiet
but still the pain is there
it won't go awayand it won't leave me alone
it's there at 3am
when i can't sleep
and it's there at 3pm
when i'm doing homework
there are no words to show
just how heavy it feels
the only way you could know
is if you felt it yourself
