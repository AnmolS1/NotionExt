ready to leave

he Ãžnished typing
the last of the letters
he hit print and knew
there was no going back now
each letter in its own envelope
all in a boxlabeled "Suicide Notes"
on the newly made bed
looking for the thick rope
still unfound
except for the knife
his trusty X-Acto knife
this would work too
he sat down in his chair
leaned back
played his favorite song
Fly Me To The Moon
one last time
song done
knife raised
he cut his left wrist
and then his right
blood fallingstained carpet
still a while left
he sat back
and began to ponderlifedeatheverything
thisis a collection
of his last thoughts
