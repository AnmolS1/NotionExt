and so the dam breaks

she said to follow her
so i went, my hand in hers
we walked along an old trail
unpaved, dirt
we walked to a bench
there she sat down
and patted next to her
so i sat, hoping for some
revelation or epiphany
i got nothing of the sort
but slowly the dam cracked
she stood and said to stay
as long as i needed
so i did, and the dam burst
and finally, i felt the agony
