day 18

merely 3 weeks
only 3 weeks
just 3 weeks
he has no idea
how much longer
life can continue
like this
where could he go
and what would he do
what could possibly
ever take away from this
incredible loss he feels
this inordinate amount of pain
this hellish amount of sad
this all-encompassing empty?
nothing
that's what he knows
that's all he knows
and there's nothing else
he knows nothing
and he knows that
he knows that nothing
is all he can do
all he can feel
because she left
she left him
alone
