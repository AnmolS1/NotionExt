unnamed 72

it can be hard
to wonder why
we are here
because the answer
the real true answer
is that there is no reason
there is no reason
for us to exist
there is no reason
for us to live
and yet
we dowe live
we breathe
we playwe laughthere is so much that we do
that we shouldn't be able to
we've gotten this far
and we can get farther
so don't give up
don't stop now
this is just the beginning
