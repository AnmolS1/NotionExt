unreal

to him
she was sapphire blue
pastel yellows
fiery red
and all the colors in between
when he looked at her
wind blew through her hair
and some old love song played
even clich‚Äùs showed their faces
as time stopped
and the world stood still
her smile was intoxicating
and her lips tasted like
strawberries
she was everything
to him
