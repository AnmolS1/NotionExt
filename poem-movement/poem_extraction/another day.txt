another day

he'd always read about it
in poems and books
how the sunlight could hit
in just the right way
and her skin would glow
like nothing else
anyone had ever seen
but he'd never believed it
never given it another thought
until her
for there they were
sitting 2 feet apart
and the sun
in all it's bright glory
made her emerald eyes
gleam
and he knew
this wasn't just another day
