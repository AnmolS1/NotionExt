unimportance

it's quite dif√ûcult for humanity
to accept that our existence
is quite a pointless one
for in the greater picture
we only exist in
the toddler years of this
what we call "our" universe
the things most of us do now
will make no difference
in a generation or two
we will all be forgotten
and the black hole
that ends up consuming us
will not be sentimental so as
to remember us in our prime
the decaying white dwarfs
will not laughas they reminisce
nor will the dying supernovas 
cry tears of longing
for the glory days of humanity
so you see
there is really no point
we will all end up goneone wayor another
