the bus window

staring through this pane of glass
as I contemplate why I do so
and contemplate in its entirety
the process of contemplation
why do we wonder?
is it a stretch in vain
or a hopeful misusage
of an unused mind
now as i wonder why we wonder
I realize that I simply don't care
I like to think, to hope, to believe
in these fantasy worlds
in my ideas and dreams
and just hope that someday
these simple ponderances of mine
might become a reality of mine
