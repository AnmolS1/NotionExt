Pure and True

sometimes i wonder what would happen
if nobody knew what love is
if authors never wrote about it
if movies never exaggerated it
if the media never exploited it
how would we love differently?
would people be happier together?
would marriage even exist?
would the social construct of
boyfriend and girlfriend
cease to be?
i'd like to think that people
would be far less stressed
people wouldn't spend their lives
looking for a soulmate
people would instead
enjoy their lives
with the peoplethey do everything with
this world would be a much better place
without a deÞnition for love
because without a deÞnition for love
it becomes a true emotion
one of the select few
that are pure and true
