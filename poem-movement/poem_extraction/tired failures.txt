tired failures

we all purport this idea of us
a false conception of our
state of being
if we are honest with ourselves
we know it serves no purpose
other than our own mental
sanity
and yet we feel it in the
deepest parts of our souls
just how tired and sad
we are
our lives come to an end
before they ever begin
and we end up beingthe worst versions of ourselves
complete and total
failures
